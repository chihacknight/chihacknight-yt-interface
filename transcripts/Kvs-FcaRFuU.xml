<p begin="00:02:24.970" end="00:02:29.860" style="s2">not<span style="s4"> being</span> open source so this was a bit</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.380" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">took some thought architectural<span style="s3"> e</span> how do</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.120" end="00:06:42.530" style="s2">we bridge this gap so it&#39;s<span style="s4"> not</span><span style="s3"> just</span> a</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.250" end="00:06:53.630" style="s2">so as<span style="s4"> I</span> mentioned before when<span style="s3"> you</span></p>

<p begin="00:07:04.250" end="00:07:07.730" style="s2">and what we&#39;re able to do in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:07:14.270" end="00:07:20.450" style="s2">together so when we architected this we</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.680" end="00:07:25.010" style="s2">have these kind of three layers<span style="s4"> that</span> we</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.450" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">always<span style="s4"> refer</span> to one is open grid that</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:30.650" style="s2">here is<span style="s4"> what</span><span style="s3"> we</span> call it&#39;s not<span style="s4"> displaying</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:29.030" end="00:07:33.860" style="s2">is quite as well it&#39;s called<span style="s4"> the</span> service</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.650" end="00:07:35.510" style="s2">layer so the interfaces should be about</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.860" end="00:07:37.490" style="s2">the same you know no<span style="s4"> matter</span> what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.510" end="00:07:39.350" style="s2">doing but we envision that there&#39;s<span style="s4"> going</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:37.490" end="00:07:41.930" style="s2">to be differences in data sources right</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.350" end="00:07:44.450" style="s2">we&#39;re going<span style="s4"> to</span> want<span style="s4"> to</span> use<span style="s4"> MongoDB</span> for</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.930" end="00:07:46.310" style="s2">our internal version which we do we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.450" end="00:07:48.770" style="s2">also going to want to<span style="s4"> maybe</span> make this</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.310" end="00:07:51.140" style="s2">public and that&#39;s how planaria fits into</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.770" end="00:07:53.240" style="s2">this planaria is a whole different</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.140" end="00:07:55.730" style="s2">project now there&#39;s a few<span style="s3"> people</span> in<span style="s4"> here</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:53.240" end="00:07:57.170" style="s2">can you raise your hand we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.730" end="00:07:58.550" style="s2">everybody<span style="s4"> in</span> here can you<span style="s4"> raise</span> your</p>

<p begin="00:07:58.550" end="00:08:04.670" style="s2">project in any sort of way look around</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.670" end="00:08:06.140" style="s2">you<span style="s4"> all right so we got about</span> handful of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.670" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">people<span style="s4"> about</span> five people<span style="s4"> and</span> that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.140" end="00:08:10.340" style="s2">all not all of university of chicago is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:14.270" style="s2">here because<span style="s4"> we got some non</span><span style="s3"> planarian</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:10.340" end="00:08:16.010" style="s2">folks here but we have a handful<span style="s4"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:14.270" end="00:08:17.660" style="s2">people working<span style="s4"> around</span> the room and many</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.010" end="00:08:20.180" style="s2">others who will come to these nights who</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.660" end="00:08:22.670" style="s2">worked on this project and pollen REO is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.180" end="00:08:24.830" style="s2">an API endpoint which combined data from</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.670" end="00:08:26.900" style="s2">the open data portal and we said hey you</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.830" end="00:08:28.460" style="s2">wait very did this data storage work</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.900" end="00:08:31.040" style="s2">when<span style="s3"> it</span> comes<span style="s4"> to</span> public data they</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.460" end="00:08:32.810" style="s2">already did the work to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.040" end="00:08:35.180" style="s2">together and<span style="s4"> create</span> an API that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.810" end="00:08:36.380" style="s2">of nifty what if<span style="s4"> we</span> take this thing<span style="s4"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:35.180" end="00:08:38.120" style="s2">we developed internally and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.380" end="00:08:39.260" style="s2">to<span style="s3"> open</span><span style="s4"> source</span> anyway but what<span style="s4"> if we</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:38.120" end="00:08:42.440" style="s2">take<span style="s4"> that</span> and we put that<span style="s4"> on</span> top of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.260" end="00:08:43.669" style="s2">linaria and then voila we have open<span style="s4"> grid</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:42.440" end="00:08:45.860" style="s2">the same interface that we&#39;ve<span style="s4"> been</span><span style="s3"> using</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:43.669" end="00:08:48.440" style="s2">internally and<span style="s3"> i&#39;m</span><span style="s4"> going to show</span> open</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.440" end="00:08:51.980" style="s2">are able to layer this on top of open</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.180" end="00:08:53.720" style="s2">data and later on top of work that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.980" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2"><span style="s4">already</span> been done<span style="s4"> also</span> an open source</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.899" end="00:09:05.810" style="s2">also get the different<span style="s3"> flavors</span> of open</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:21.230" style="s2">so you<span style="s4"> just</span> take the user interface you</p>

<p begin="00:36:01.910" end="00:36:06.469" style="s2">this is these<span style="s3"> are</span><span style="s4"> real</span> issues right no</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.309" end="00:36:09.170" style="s2">different than many people<span style="s3"> i</span> know<span style="s3"> we</span> my</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.059" end="00:36:26.930" style="s2">relative ease so basically<span style="s3"> our</span> big</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.309" end="00:36:28.999" style="s2">things is if we have a data set that has</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.930" end="00:36:30.890" style="s2">a lot long on it and we have<span style="s3"> a</span> time</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.999" end="00:36:32.119" style="s2">stamp associated with it it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.890" end="00:36:37.239" style="s2">easy for<span style="s4"> us</span> to get<span style="s4"> that</span> wrapped into</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.119" end="00:36:37.239" style="s2">plenary oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:47.070" style="s2">this is a really<span style="s4"> good</span> question<span style="s3"> because</span></p>
<p begin="00:36:44.550" end="00:36:49.050" style="s2">internally in windy grid we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.070" end="00:36:50.670" style="s2">receiving that request for about two</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.050" end="00:36:53.250" style="s2">years now and we&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.670" end="00:36:56.730" style="s2">through do we want<span style="s4"> to</span> do that how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.250" end="00:36:58.080" style="s2">want<span style="s4"> to</span> do that so we&#39;ve certainly been</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.730" end="00:36:59.550" style="s2">thinking about because of the<span style="s4"> feedback</span></p>
<p begin="00:36:58.080" end="00:37:01.859" style="s2">we&#39;ve gotten specifically from<span style="s4"> City</span></p>
<p begin="00:36:59.550" end="00:37:03.420" style="s2">users and if we can start<span style="s3"> getting</span><span style="s4"> it</span></p>
<p begin="00:37:01.859" end="00:37:04.710" style="s2">from the public as well that would<span style="s4"> be</span></p>
<p begin="00:37:03.420" end="00:37:08.040" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s very compelling to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.710" end="00:37:10.380" style="s2">it&#39;s if I<span style="s3"> could</span> I would at a moment but</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.040" end="00:37:11.460" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s always not what you do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.380" end="00:37:13.500" style="s2">what you&#39;re<span style="s4"> not</span><span style="s3"> doing</span> when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.460" end="00:37:16.740" style="s2">something and that&#39;s been what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.500" end="00:37:19.650" style="s2">weighing on our mind<span style="s3"> oh</span> the question was</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.740" end="00:37:21.690" style="s2">what about<span style="s4"> being</span><span style="s3"> able</span><span style="s4"> to</span> submit 311</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.650" end="00:37:23.070" style="s2">request to<span style="s4"> the</span> interface right so click</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.690" end="00:37:24.930" style="s2">on<span style="s4"> a</span> button here<span style="s3"> and</span> say hey I found a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.070" end="00:37:26.369" style="s2">pot hole right here and just be<span style="s4"> able to</span></p>
<p begin="00:37:24.930" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2"><span style="s4">do</span> it<span style="s3"> from</span><span style="s4"> the</span> interface which is again</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.369" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">a fantastic idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.490" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;ve been had especially the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.770" end="00:37:51.780" style="s2">CIO has been point on on procurement</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:52.620" style="s2">issues in ways that we can make<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:37:51.780" end="00:37:54.930" style="s2">better I think there&#39;s a<span style="s4"> lot of</span></p>
<p begin="00:37:52.620" end="00:37:56.310" style="s2">experimentation going on right now 18f</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.930" end="00:37:58.650" style="s2">has interesting model will see if<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:37:56.310" end="00:38:01.320" style="s2">pans out what&#39;s but really troublesome</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.650" end="00:38:03.990" style="s2">is<span style="s4"> I mean he&#39;ll there&#39;s a city employee</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:01.320" end="00:38:05.820" style="s2">and a CEO on trial now right the sins of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.990" end="00:38:07.620" style="s2">the<span style="s4"> past</span> is what creates these burdens</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.820" end="00:38:09.960" style="s2">now and so that&#39;s a really<span style="s3"> tough</span><span style="s4"> thing</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:07.620" end="00:38:11.400" style="s2">to balance right of how do we make<span style="s3"> it</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:09.960" end="00:38:13.500" style="s2">easy to do it but how do<span style="s4"> we</span> make sure</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.400" end="00:38:15.150" style="s2">that sons of<span style="s4"> bitches don&#39;t abuse it</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:13.500" end="00:38:17.130" style="s2">right because<span style="s4"> I</span><span style="s3"> think</span><span style="s4"> the guy this guy</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:15.150" end="00:38:20.670" style="s2">took<span style="s3"> fourteen</span> thousand dollars at least</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.130" end="00:38:22.740" style="s2">allegedly so far<span style="s4"> just pure</span><span style="s3"> brought</span> so we</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.670" end="00:38:26.040" style="s2">have to balance that so i&#39;m<span style="s4"> not i don&#39;t</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:22.740" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">think we can answer right now but</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.040" end="00:38:30.450" style="s2">something<span style="s3"> that</span> is is interesting here is</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.310" style="s2">that we&#39;re able to work together in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.450" end="00:38:34.050" style="s2">open like this right<span style="s3"> we&#39;re</span><span style="s4"> working</span> to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.310" end="00:38:35.430" style="s2">with an open source projects and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.050" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">people<span style="s3"> can</span> contribute<span style="s4"> to</span> the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.430" end="00:38:39.780" style="s2">they do want<span style="s4"> to and not want to the</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">other thing too that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.780" end="00:38:45.270" style="s2">of how we design this is open grid again</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:47.370" style="s2">is not<span style="s4"> only</span> just for the open portal but</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.270" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">is also dependent on internal operations</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.370" end="00:38:51.780" style="s2">as well which creates the onus on us to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:53.340" style="s2">be able make<span style="s4"> sure</span> that we maintain it to</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.780" end="00:38:56.070" style="s2">make<span style="s4"> sure</span> that we don&#39;t let this thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.340" end="00:38:58.080" style="s2">wither and die but we continue to make<span style="s3"> a</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:56.070" end="00:38:59.550" style="s2">concentrated investment into it while</p>
