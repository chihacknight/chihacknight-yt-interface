<p begin="00:33:05.520" end="00:33:09.660" style="s2">recycle is a website<span style="s4"> where</span> people who</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.080" end="00:33:17.610" style="s2">their landlord or building owner so we</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.480" end="00:33:20.970" style="s2">have amassed a lot of<span style="s4"> records</span> I think we</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.610" end="00:33:22.500" style="s2"><span style="s4">have</span> about almost<span style="s4"> three thousand reports</span></p>

<p begin="00:33:27.300" end="00:33:34.770" style="s2">recently being the NBC<span style="s4"> 5</span> investigation</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:37.740" style="s2"><span style="s4">the</span> concern looking women up there so</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.740" end="00:33:46.470" style="s2">missing advocacy so our original goal</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.330" end="00:33:49.650" style="s2">was really to so our original goal was</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.470" end="00:33:51.450" style="s2">to get the<span style="s3"> city</span> to actually enforce the</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.580" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">despite the media coverage and just the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.830" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">attention to the site so I am proposing</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:07.260" style="s2">some changes which i think i myself will</p>

<p begin="00:43:20.940" end="00:43:27.660" style="s2">um but I think that tech can mean a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.539" end="00:43:31.259" style="s2"><span style="s3">of things and apps are just a tiny tiny</span></p>
<p begin="00:43:27.660" end="00:43:34.259" style="s2">sliver um and one thing<span style="s4"> about</span> apps is</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.259" end="00:43:36.479" style="s2">that they&#39;re<span style="s3"> really</span> hard to<span style="s4"> make</span> there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.259" end="00:43:39.719" style="s2">a<span style="s3"> reason</span> why instagram has like a giant</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.479" end="00:43:41.549" style="s2">team of paid engineers so while apps are</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.719" end="00:43:45.959" style="s2">great<span style="s4"> i</span> don&#39;t<span style="s3"> think</span> they&#39;re they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.549" end="00:43:49.410" style="s2">best fit<span style="s4"> for</span> volunteer projects and also</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.959" end="00:43:52.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind<span style="s3"> of</span> more subtle issue with</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.410" end="00:43:54.330" style="s2">focusing on apps which is<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:43:52.110" end="00:43:58.140" style="s2">apps are often not inclusive it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.330" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2"><span style="s4">hard to get a</span><span style="s3"> volunteer</span> project<span style="s3"> that&#39;s</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.140" end="00:44:01.770" style="s2">nap and also involve a lot of<span style="s3"> people</span> who</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">are not developers because having apps</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.770" end="00:44:07.740" style="s2">just<span style="s3"> really</span> privileges coding over other</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:09.750" style="s2">types of work so anyways let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.740" end="00:44:12.300" style="s2">about some<span style="s3"> other</span> types of cool projects</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.750" end="00:44:14.610" style="s2">that aren&#39;t app so if you&#39;re<span style="s4"> looking</span> to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.300" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">volunteer here and you&#39;re like not</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:23.340" style="s2">breakout group ideas um so one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.770" end="00:44:25.770" style="s2">love is Bob so Bob are much more</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.340" end="00:44:28.050" style="s2">lightweight than apps and require much</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.770" end="00:44:30.690" style="s2">less maintenance what I really like is a</p>
