<p begin="00:12:22.290" end="00:12:27.720" style="s2">how they use computers to analyze that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.110" end="00:12:29.370" style="s2">data and like<span style="s3"> further</span> the research and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.720" end="00:12:31.199" style="s2">even though you&#39;re going in the medical</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.370" end="00:12:34.860" style="s2">field you know automatic think of cs but</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.199" end="00:12:37.529" style="s2">you do use computers another thing we</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.860" end="00:12:40.139" style="s2">also gasps from this we also gather from</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.529" end="00:12:42.899" style="s2">the student surveys where like the axis</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.139" end="00:12:45.329" style="s2">between computers and mobile access so</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.899" end="00:12:47.670" style="s2">like we saw that there&#39;s a need for</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.329" end="00:12:50.040" style="s2">mobile friendly resources in like</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.670" end="00:12:51.750" style="s2">schools and like just resources that</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.040" end="00:12:54.779" style="s2">provide to the student so the question</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.750" end="00:12:57.329" style="s2">we had asked what was what technology do</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.779" end="00:12:59.819" style="s2">they like regular use like per week like</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.329" end="00:13:03.209" style="s2">three to four three to five<span style="s4"> times</span> a<span style="s4"> week</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:59.819" end="00:13:05.310" style="s2">and even<span style="s4"> though</span> like 78.2 percent</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.209" end="00:13:08.759" style="s2">students said that they use<span style="s4"> the</span> computer</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.310" end="00:13:11.370" style="s2">mostly every<span style="s4"> students</span> that on actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.759" end="00:13:15.750" style="s2">exactly 93.3 percent of students said</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.370" end="00:13:17.819" style="s2">that they use a smartphone um on like</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.750" end="00:13:20.610" style="s2">weekly and from here we took away that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.819" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">like we need learning tools that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.610" end="00:13:25.860" style="s2">more<span style="s3"> mobile-friendly</span> to increase like</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:27.959" style="s2">self studying and stuff and like have</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.860" end="00:13:29.790" style="s2">more learning access to<span style="s4"> Austin</span> and<span style="s3"> so</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:27.959" end="00:13:31.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like BYOD like bring your<span style="s3"> own</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:29.790" end="00:13:33.540" style="s2">device and learn about computer science</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.230" end="00:13:35.160" style="s2">within the classroom like<span style="s3"> I</span> mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.540" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">students<span style="s3"> are</span> like we all have our phones</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:42.360" style="s2"><span style="s3">finally</span> like a huge question that since</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.259" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">we had in the beginning like<span style="s3"> is</span> CS even</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.360" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">relevant like should<span style="s4"> I</span> even be in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.040" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">CPS curriculum and yes it is<span style="s3"> relevant</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:46.620" end="00:13:51.720" style="s2">like and like i said before like 78.1</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:53.790" style="s2">percent of students said yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.720" end="00:13:55.769" style="s2">TS is needed like CSS a skill we all</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.790" end="00:13:56.879" style="s2">should obtain like<span style="s4"> ended</span> why shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.769" end="00:13:59.610" style="s2">it be in high school why shouldn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.879" end="00:14:01.079" style="s2">learn it done like some quotes that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.610" end="00:14:03.660" style="s2">had gathered from the student interviews</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.079" end="00:14:06.149" style="s2">and the surveys was one<span style="s3"> that</span> really<span style="s3"> stir</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:03.660" end="00:14:07.740" style="s2">like most jobs in the future or now deal</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.149" end="00:14:09.240" style="s2">with computer science in some way and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.740" end="00:14:11.069" style="s2">knowing these skills will help you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.240" end="00:14:13.319" style="s2">prepare will help prepare students for</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.069" end="00:14:16.290" style="s2">their future jobs and actually a quote<span style="s3"> I</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:13.319" end="00:14:17.639" style="s2">really like<span style="s4"> to</span> they said it<span style="s4"> is</span> essential</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.639" end="00:14:21.720" style="s2">technologically<span style="s3"> literate</span> seeing as this</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.920" end="00:14:24.120" style="s2">technology the instant keeps developing</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.889" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">evident to us and a huge check away from</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.470" end="00:14:32.310" style="s2">that was<span style="s4"> that</span> most students like<span style="s4"> being</span></p>

<p begin="00:14:32.310" end="00:14:36.839" style="s2">a<span style="s4"> valuable</span> skill that we should learn</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.779" end="00:14:38.730" style="s2">early on but like students faced a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.839" end="00:14:40.889" style="s2">of barriers like do they have<span style="s3"> the</span> tech</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.730" end="00:14:42.959" style="s2">for it do they have the<span style="s3"> resources</span> to</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.959" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">mentors are teaching it and like just to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">preach like pursue computer science over</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:55.189" style="s2">time and to pass it on to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:55.189" style="s2">edgy map I will pass it<span style="s4"> to</span> Marshall</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.149" end="00:15:01.559" style="s2">hello there uh so I&#39;m<span style="s4"> gonna start by</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:59.730" end="00:15:04.920" style="s2">asking you guys a question<span style="s3"> how</span> many of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.559" end="00:15:07.500" style="s2">you tried to hunt<span style="s3"> down</span> a teacher to get</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.920" end="00:15:09.540" style="s2">information<span style="s4"> from</span><span style="s3"> them</span> show of hands and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.500" end="00:15:11.910" style="s2"><span style="s3">not</span> many<span style="s4"> well</span> it&#39;s<span style="s3"> pretty</span> difficult and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.540" end="00:15:14.699" style="s2">that&#39;s what we<span style="s4"> did</span> we spend a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.910" end="00:15:16.860" style="s2">time doing that and you know<span style="s3"> as</span> a result</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.699" end="00:15:19.559" style="s2">we ended up getting fewer teachers than</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.860" end="00:15:23.459" style="s2"><span style="s3">we</span> had originally interpreted and on top</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.559" end="00:15:25.139" style="s2">of that not<span style="s3"> only</span> did we get fewer</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.459" end="00:15:27.569" style="s2">teachers but we had<span style="s4"> to</span> interview</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.139" end="00:15:29.459" style="s2">teachers who taught a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.569" end="00:15:31.860" style="s2"><span style="s4">different</span> grades not just computer</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.459" end="00:15:33.629" style="s2">science teachers now I bet<span style="s3"> you</span> guys are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.860" end="00:15:36.649" style="s2">wondering<span style="s3"> what is edge your map well</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:33.629" end="00:15:39.660" style="s2">edge your map is a compilation of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.649" end="00:15:42.149" style="s2">computer science resources for computer</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.660" end="00:15:47.089" style="s2">science teachers to utilize and to help</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.149" end="00:15:47.089" style="s2">build their curriculum so uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.459" end="00:15:55.189" style="s2">so pretty much we went out and we did</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.249" end="00:15:57.670" style="s2">usability tests and the usability test</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.189" end="00:16:03.230" style="s2">was pretty much three different parts</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.670" end="00:16:05.389" style="s2">the first part was just a simple first</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.230" end="00:16:07.309" style="s2">impression thing we<span style="s3"> would</span> ask<span style="s3"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:16:05.389" end="00:16:09.100" style="s2">teachers what are the first three words</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.309" end="00:16:11.029" style="s2">that comes to mind when<span style="s3"> you</span> see this</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.100" end="00:16:13.879" style="s2">website interface and they would say</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.879" end="00:16:19.850" style="s2">very usable so<span style="s4"> after</span><span style="s3"> that</span> we<span style="s3"> asked</span> them</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.270" end="00:18:29.159" style="s2">the third<span style="s3"> takeaway</span> is that we found<span style="s3"> out</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:26.760" end="00:18:31.470" style="s2">that<span style="s3"> the</span> edge amount should be<span style="s4"> an app</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:29.159" end="00:18:33.990" style="s2">because like I know like almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.470" end="00:18:37.500" style="s2">everybody<span style="s3"> has</span> an app like is<span style="s3"> anybody</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:33.990" end="00:18:39.450" style="s2">using an app right now so basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.500" end="00:18:42.049" style="s2">everybody is actually in a nap so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.450" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">like<span style="s3"> a</span> quicker way to get<span style="s3"> resources</span> and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.049" end="00:18:47.700" style="s2">no fourth take away we found out is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:49.500" style="s2">teachers actually enjoyed the<span style="s3"> the</span></p>

<p begin="00:21:11.049" end="00:21:15.759" style="s2">know um computer science education is</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.749" end="00:21:18.639" style="s2">essential to like basic computer</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.759" end="00:21:21.249" style="s2">literacy like unfair already existing</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.639" end="00:21:23.289" style="s2">like in libraries and such courses that</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.249" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">do teach like basic computer literacy</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.289" end="00:21:30.009" style="s2">like why is that like it&#39;s<span style="s3"> not</span> high</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:42.490" style="s2">enough of a bar likewise fold like</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.009" end="00:21:44.919" style="s2">computer science education needed so so</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.490" end="00:21:46.749" style="s2">basically it is not actually enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.919" end="00:21:49.720" style="s2">because you know that technology is</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.749" end="00:21:51.490" style="s2">actually advancing and if as technology</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.720" end="00:21:53.830" style="s2">advances is advancing everybody should</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.490" end="00:21:55.990" style="s2"><span style="s4">know</span> how to<span style="s4"> operate</span> it rather<span style="s3"> than</span> like</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.830" end="00:21:58.419" style="s2">a little set of<span style="s3"> people</span> because<span style="s3"> that&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:55.990" end="00:22:00.639" style="s2">like okay you&#39;ve like I actually found</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.419" end="00:22:02.740" style="s2">out that<span style="s4"> basin</span> right now most<span style="s3"> of</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.639" end="00:22:05.259" style="s2">jobs are like for college student right</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.740" end="00:22:08.440" style="s2">not I school student so like if the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.259" end="00:22:10.419" style="s2">lowest people like having<span style="s4"> experience</span> to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.440" end="00:22:12.039" style="s2">computer science damage like that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.419" end="00:22:13.629" style="s2">a set of<span style="s4"> people</span> that are going<span style="s3"> to</span> like</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.039" end="00:22:15.879" style="s2">be able<span style="s3"> to operate computer science</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:13.629" end="00:22:17.110" style="s2">though but that shows like even the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.879" end="00:22:19.269" style="s2">program is not going to be enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.110" end="00:22:21.490" style="s2">because as things advantage we should</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.269" end="00:22:24.580" style="s2">get<span style="s3"> more</span> knowledge about it that&#39;s why<span style="s3"> I</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:21.490" end="00:22:28.169" style="s2">will say the<span style="s3"> computer courses taught in</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:24.580" end="00:22:28.169" style="s2">the library are not actually enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.550" end="00:22:33.290" style="s2"><span style="s3">I&#39;m</span> also gonna mention a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.560" end="00:22:37.310" style="s2"><span style="s3">about</span> that there was one<span style="s3"> survey</span> question</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.290" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">that we asked and<span style="s3"> it</span> was do you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.310" end="00:22:41.720" style="s2">computer science is important and if not</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:43.730" style="s2">why we were looking at<span style="s3"> the</span> yeses and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.720" end="00:22:46.430" style="s2">nose and the maybes and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.730" end="00:22:47.930" style="s2">nose were about like careers they would</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.430" end="00:22:49.700" style="s2">be like no I&#39;m not interested in</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.930" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2"><span style="s3">computer</span> science because I don&#39;t<span style="s4"> want</span> to</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.700" end="00:22:55.400" style="s2">do computer science as a career so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:58.670" style="s2">came to realize<span style="s4"> that</span> a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.400" end="00:23:01.160" style="s2">don&#39;t really like fully understand the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.670" end="00:23:03.500" style="s2">entire roll of computer science and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.160" end="00:23:07.070" style="s2">society where is it&#39;s more<span style="s3"> than</span> just a</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.549" end="00:25:12.530" style="s2">you can get<span style="s3"> a</span> good computer science</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.960" end="00:25:14.690" style="s2">education i agree but um<span style="s3"> that</span> that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.530" end="00:25:17.530" style="s2">separate from the<span style="s4"> the</span> project that<span style="s3"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:14.690" end="00:25:17.530" style="s2">interns were working on</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.470" end="00:25:31.340" style="s2">so quick question<span style="s4"> did you guys include</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:29.179" end="00:25:32.840" style="s2">librarians in your survey teachers talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.340" end="00:25:35.000" style="s2">to and if<span style="s4"> so</span> how did<span style="s3"> that</span> conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.840" end="00:25:36.830" style="s2">changed a little bit just<span style="s3"> because</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.000" end="00:25:38.929" style="s2">few programs I&#39;ve done it at<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:36.830" end="00:25:41.570" style="s2">actually found the librarians<span style="s4"> poured</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.929" end="00:25:43.460" style="s2">ones<span style="s3"> tonight</span> champion champion I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.570" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">talk to<span style="s4"> it</span><span style="s3"> they&#39;re</span> the ones leaving the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.460" end="00:25:48.770" style="s2">leaving the calls<span style="s3"> and</span> I&#39;m kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:50.870" style="s2">great<span style="s4"> help um back head that intersects</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:48.770" end="00:26:00.710" style="s2">with some of the more classroom teachers</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.870" end="00:26:02.929" style="s2">as you will when we&#39;re serving our yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.710" end="00:26:05.630" style="s2">when we conducted our surveys we did not</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.929" end="00:26:08.290" style="s2">include librarians but that sounds<span style="s4"> like</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:05.630" end="00:26:10.910" style="s2">something very interesting to dive into</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.290" end="00:26:12.440" style="s2">and i&#39;ll<span style="s3"> just</span> make a side comment that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.910" end="00:26:14.150" style="s2">in our<span style="s3"> district</span> there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.440" end="00:26:15.950" style="s2">teachers who<span style="s4"> are</span> also the librarian and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.150" end="00:26:17.240" style="s2">also the tech<span style="s4"> co</span> so some of the teachers</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.950" end="00:26:21.830" style="s2">that they spoke<span style="s3"> to</span> may have been a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.240" end="00:26:23.390" style="s2">librarian secretly and<span style="s3"> i</span> agree that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.830" end="00:26:25.340" style="s2"><span style="s4">that&#39;s</span> one of the avenues that we get a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.390" end="00:26:27.230" style="s2">lot of support and push from schools</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.340" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">because librarians are often responsible</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.230" end="00:26:31.640" style="s2">for the digital literacy portion of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:32.750" style="s2">student&#39;s education which is usually</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.640" end="00:26:35.480" style="s2">separate from the computer science</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.750" end="00:26:37.669" style="s2">education which is distinct so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.480" end="00:26:39.559" style="s2">there are a lot of teachers<span style="s3"> that</span> play</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.669" end="00:26:41.480" style="s2">multiple roles and tech<span style="s4"> O&#39;s</span> and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.559" end="00:26:47.720" style="s2">librarians are one of the sources of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.480" end="00:26:49.700" style="s2">support that<span style="s3"> we</span> have to add to<span style="s4"> what</span> Andy</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.720" end="00:26:53.000" style="s2">said like we know that<span style="s4"> most</span> of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.700" end="00:26:55.549" style="s2">student time is always<span style="s3"> in</span> school so um i</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.000" end="00:26:58.220" style="s2">would say going to the library is kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.549" end="00:27:00.890" style="s2">of like I&#39;m<span style="s3"> good</span> but like it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.220" end="00:27:02.390" style="s2">strapon linear so lemon is like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.890" end="00:27:03.669" style="s2">could<span style="s3"> just</span> focus on where the students</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.390" end="00:27:05.900" style="s2">are<span style="s4"> actually</span> gonna get the education</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.669" end="00:27:09.860" style="s2">because like going to the library is</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.900" end="00:27:12.230" style="s2">like saying okay this is where like we</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.860" end="00:27:14.059" style="s2">use for CPS right and CPI certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.230" end="00:27:17.030" style="s2">actually operate in<span style="s3"> the</span> library kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.059" end="00:27:19.940" style="s2">but<span style="s4"> like I said like</span><span style="s3"> going</span> to life is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.030" end="00:27:24.040" style="s2">good place but we&#39;re trying to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.940" end="00:27:24.040" style="s2">the CPS<span style="s3"> and</span> I&#39;ll stood at learn</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.800" end="00:27:37.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a<span style="s4"> pose</span> as a vice my question is</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:39.280" style="s2">regarding the outlook for increasing</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.130" end="00:27:42.800" style="s2">computer science literacy among teachers</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.280" end="00:27:46.130" style="s2">over the next<span style="s3"> 10</span> to 20 years to what</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.800" end="00:27:48.020" style="s2">extent our teachers right now excited<span style="s4"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:46.130" end="00:27:53.390" style="s2">prepare<span style="s3"> to</span> teach about computer science</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.020" end="00:27:55.580" style="s2">and<span style="s4"> that</span> to what extent is the education</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.390" end="00:27:56.840" style="s2">system in<span style="s3"> America</span> producing teachers who</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.580" end="00:28:00.530" style="s2">are capable<span style="s3"> of</span> teaching computer science</p>

<p begin="00:28:05.090" end="00:28:15.170" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna stop so again this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.820" end="00:28:16.700" style="s2"><span style="s4">something</span> that is very important to<span style="s3"> the</span></p>

<p begin="00:28:18.650" end="00:28:22.160" style="s2">to teach<span style="s4"> it</span> well and that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.210" end="00:29:12.110" style="s2">get there<span style="s4"> I</span> think<span style="s3"> over</span> time as as more</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.070" end="00:29:13.730" style="s2">and more people who are<span style="s3"> more</span> excited</p>

<p begin="00:29:13.730" end="00:29:18.710" style="s2">are getting into this so we&#39;re creating</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.170" end="00:29:28.670" style="s2">or I&#39;ll do this one</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.880" end="00:29:30.720" style="s2">so I the finger of searching was</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.670" end="00:29:34.170" style="s2">computer science in school but your</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:35.310" style="s2">project itself was probably to me looked</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.170" end="00:29:38.160" style="s2">a little bit different but related it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.310" end="00:29:39.690" style="s2">more like a general<span style="s3"> data</span> or scientific</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.160" end="00:29:42.090" style="s2">research project so I want<span style="s3"> to</span> hear about</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.690" end="00:29:44.760" style="s2">what<span style="s3"> you</span> found in the process of doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.090" end="00:29:46.140" style="s2">this project like what you enjoy<span style="s3"> what</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:44.760" end="00:29:47.700" style="s2">you learn and how that affects your</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.140" end="00:29:49.380" style="s2">perception of what you<span style="s3"> want to do it&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:47.700" end="00:29:59.040" style="s2">more data related or<span style="s3"> a few sites</span><span style="s4"> where</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:49.380" end="00:30:06.660" style="s2"><span style="s3">though not month ago</span><span style="s4"> alright</span> I guess<span style="s4"> I</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:59.040" end="00:30:08.310" style="s2">go<span style="s3"> alright alright so some of the</span></p>
<p begin="00:30:06.660" end="00:30:11.130" style="s2">interesting things that<span style="s3"> I</span> got from our</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.310" end="00:30:14.340" style="s2">research was that like even though the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.130" end="00:30:17.130" style="s2">student<span style="s4"> like</span> Jessica mentioned even</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.340" end="00:30:19.770" style="s2"><span style="s3">though</span> the students are<span style="s4"> not</span> really into</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.130" end="00:30:21.630" style="s2">computer science they know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.770" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">necessary for the future because they</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.630" end="00:30:27.450" style="s2">see that they cannot go out a day with</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.150" end="00:30:29.190" style="s2">other cell phones and how are they going</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.450" end="00:30:31.550" style="s2">to be able to use more<span style="s3"> advanced</span></p>
<p begin="00:30:29.190" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2"><span style="s4">technology</span> as they go deeper into our</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.550" end="00:30:38.280" style="s2">into the future or like as we just go</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:39.780" style="s2">deeper into life and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.280" end="00:30:42.180" style="s2">that really caught my attention that</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.780" end="00:30:51.780" style="s2">this students are very<span style="s3"> interested</span> in to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.180" end="00:30:54.630" style="s2"><span style="s3">like</span> in learning computer science have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.780" end="00:30:59.280" style="s2"><span style="s3">question</span> and as any<span style="s4"> of</span> you ever what</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.630" end="00:31:02.610" style="s2">like a sci-fi movie like matrix any so</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.280" end="00:31:05.960" style="s2"><span style="s3">basically</span> like seriously like does like</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.610" end="00:31:08.580" style="s2">that suppose imagine a Magna tree</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.960" end="00:31:12.210" style="s2">advance of Technology right so basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.580" end="00:31:14.040" style="s2"><span style="s3">if</span> you think like um like if you think</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.210" end="00:31:16.140" style="s2"><span style="s4">like</span> a student I know I supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.040" end="00:31:19.010" style="s2"><span style="s3">computer</span> how would<span style="s4"> I be able to like</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:16.140" end="00:31:21.620" style="s2">operate the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.010" end="00:31:24.560" style="s2">so you yeah I said the question myself</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.620" end="00:31:30.440" style="s2">so basically that&#39;s like what I totally</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.560" end="00:31:32.360" style="s2">trust me don&#39;t do the survey so just</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.440" end="00:31:35.690" style="s2">like quickly like you guys saw the video</p>

<p begin="00:31:37.820" end="00:31:43.460" style="s2">didn&#39;t provide a CS class but like I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.820" end="00:31:45.860" style="s2">exposed to some type of tech class in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.460" end="00:31:48.050" style="s2">school which was nothing close to CS and</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.860" end="00:31:50.840" style="s2">like from there<span style="s3"> I</span> had to go myself and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.050" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">look for resources and teach myself how</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.840" end="00:31:54.800" style="s2">to like cold in all this because i had a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:56.450" style="s2">like an interest in it but<span style="s3"> i</span> would<span style="s3"> have</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:54.800" end="00:31:58.220" style="s2"><span style="s3">been</span> amazing if my school would have had</p>

<p begin="00:31:58.220" end="00:32:02.120" style="s2">of<span style="s3"> it</span> like you don&#39;t<span style="s4"> know</span> who else like</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.620" end="00:32:03.560" style="s2">in my school like they might have</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.120" end="00:32:05.480" style="s2">sparked an interest in it but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.560" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">have<span style="s4"> the class so we would never get</span></p>
<p begin="00:32:05.480" end="00:32:09.890" style="s2">exposed<span style="s3"> to</span> it so<span style="s4"> i</span> don&#39;t know that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:11.720" style="s2">i personally like really enjoy getting</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.030" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">don&#39;t<span style="s3"> get</span> any exposure but they know</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.040" end="00:32:22.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge importance to CS and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:29.890" style="s2">there should be implemented<span style="s4"> in</span> CPS</p>

<p begin="00:33:20.880" end="00:33:25.710" style="s2">knowledge of computer science I remember</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.640" end="00:33:27.900" style="s2">when<span style="s4"> I</span> would interview students<span style="s3"> I&#39;d</span> ask</p>
