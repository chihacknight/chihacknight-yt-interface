<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">here so then things were getting very</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.920" end="00:17:36.120" style="s2">exciting<span style="s3"> people</span> starting to put up</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:38.250" style="s2">election posters I think this<span style="s4"> woman&#39;s</span> an</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.250" end="00:17:42.600" style="s2">thing about being independent is you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.990" end="00:17:45.480" style="s2">to pick your<span style="s3"> own</span> party symbol she had</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.600" end="00:17:46.510" style="s2">this kind of like Russian egg thing</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.510" end="00:17:51.220" style="s2">and she would put the same information</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.190" end="00:17:54.370" style="s2">this<span style="s4"> form</span> has her education system<span style="s3"> her</span></p>

<p begin="00:17:54.370" end="00:17:58.600" style="s2">all the same information<span style="s3"> that</span> was on</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.720" end="00:18:00.850" style="s2">Form<span style="s4"> 6</span> she&#39;s posting it publicly so we</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.600" end="00:18:02.710" style="s2">felt<span style="s4"> pretty</span> good about having our API</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.850" end="00:18:03.580" style="s2">share this information as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.710" end="00:18:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;re collecting all this</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.580" end="00:18:07.120" style="s2">data not just for the government but</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.440" end="00:18:10.750" style="s2">we&#39;re going<span style="s3"> to</span> post it all in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:13.810" style="s2">public API and see what happens and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.750" end="00:18:15.670" style="s2">the way people get information right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.810" end="00:18:17.770" style="s2"><span style="s3">if</span> people don&#39;t have<span style="s3"> smartphones</span> or</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.670" end="00:18:19.900" style="s2">newspapers or radios is there these</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.770" end="00:18:21.730" style="s2"><span style="s3">trucks</span> that go around with posters and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.900" end="00:18:23.320" style="s2">loudspeakers and tell people please vote</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.730" end="00:18:25.870" style="s2">for<span style="s4"> your</span> party here are your local</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.320" end="00:18:28.950" style="s2">candidates and so you get<span style="s3"> to</span> know who</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.870" end="00:18:32.070" style="s2">your local candidates are for<span style="s3"> that</span> party</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.950" end="00:18:34.300" style="s2">so then we created a hackathon and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.070" end="00:18:35.710" style="s2">people here I imagine a lot of<span style="s3"> you</span> have</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.300" end="00:18:40.120" style="s2"><span style="s3">done</span> many of you have done<span style="s4"> a</span> hackathon</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.710" end="00:18:41.320" style="s2">yes great great great<span style="s3"> so</span> I think when</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.120" end="00:18:43.120" style="s2">people typically think about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.320" end="00:18:44.920" style="s2">hackathons I thinking<span style="s3"> about</span> all night or</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.120" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">hackathons and this happened we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.920" end="00:18:48.760" style="s2">many people sleeping I slept over you</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:50.680" style="s2">know<span style="s3"> and</span> make it cool sounds fun to love</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.760" end="00:18:52.570" style="s2">people but it&#39;s not very sustainable I</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.680" end="00:18:56.290" style="s2">mean this is criticism<span style="s3"> of</span> any hackathon</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.570" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">but you know if<span style="s3"> you</span> say oh you<span style="s4"> know</span> this</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.290" end="00:19:00.460" style="s2">project we want to have<span style="s3"> an</span> election app</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:01.950" style="s2">that everyone&#39;s<span style="s4"> going</span> to use and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.460" end="00:19:04.660" style="s2">just get people in the room for</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.950" end="00:19:07.600" style="s2">overnight hackathon like 48 hours over</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.660" end="00:19:08.830" style="s2"><span style="s3">the</span> weekend and then say<span style="s3"> okay</span> great in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.600" end="00:19:11.860" style="s2">month there&#39;s the election make sure</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.830" end="00:19:14.800" style="s2">everyone<span style="s4"> is</span> able to<span style="s3"> use</span> your<span style="s3"> app</span> those</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.860" end="00:19:16.870" style="s2">people<span style="s3"> disperse</span> they go away so we had</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.800" end="00:19:18.550" style="s2">this discussion for a long time we</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.870" end="00:19:21.310" style="s2"><span style="s4">thought</span> would be good to<span style="s3"> have</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.550" end="00:19:23.560" style="s2">two-week-long hackathon the first</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.310" end="00:19:25.750" style="s2">weekend there&#39;s the launch there&#39;s intro</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.560" end="00:19:27.400" style="s2">we explain everything we were able<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:25.750" end="00:19:29.740" style="s2">get some<span style="s3"> of</span> the candidate data released</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.400" end="00:19:30.820" style="s2">so that we could share<span style="s3"> it</span> with people we</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.740" end="00:19:33.220" style="s2">didn&#39;t<span style="s3"> want to release all of our</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:30.820" end="00:19:36.130" style="s2">candidate data at once because some</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.220" end="00:19:38.410" style="s2">candidates did not meet the criteria of</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.130" end="00:19:40.570" style="s2">approval and we very bad if<span style="s4"> we</span> released</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.410" end="00:19:42.520" style="s2">a candidate who was not approved and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.570" end="00:19:44.110" style="s2">shared their information or led people</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.520" end="00:19:46.150" style="s2">to believe that that person was running</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.110" end="00:19:48.100" style="s2">so we waited for information to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.150" end="00:19:49.990" style="s2">officially and over the<span style="s4"> course</span> of this</p>
