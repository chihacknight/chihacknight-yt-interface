<p begin="00:00:16.350" end="00:00:23.250" style="s2">we are seeking<span style="s4"> to</span> do is to hack the</p>

<p begin="00:00:44.100" end="00:00:47.789" style="s2">the first to<span style="s4"> admit</span> that but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.110" end="00:00:49.170" style="s2">basically re-entry is after you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:00:55.320" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2"><span style="s4">there&#39;s</span> a lot of challenges that we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.610" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">found and we&#39;re experiencing other</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:03.420" style="s2">people are<span style="s3"> having</span> in this process<span style="s4"> and</span> so</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:05.189" style="s2">our goal was to come<span style="s3"> together</span> as a group</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.420" end="00:01:06.990" style="s2">and figure out the best way to attack</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.189" end="00:01:09.450" style="s2">some of these<span style="s4"> challenges so as you can</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:06.990" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">see these<span style="s3"> are</span> some of<span style="s4"> the</span> popular stats</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.450" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">around this around<span style="s4"> the</span> challenges which</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2"><span style="s4">brings</span> us to the event<span style="s4"> that</span> we had about</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">a month ago so this<span style="s4"> is</span> a<span style="s3"> two day event</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:16.920" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">that we had in anglewood exactly a month</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">go from today and the first night we had</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">a documentary screening of two<span style="s3"> people</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">that are experiencing reentry and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">follows them through the process and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">second day we had our colab so what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:38.880" style="s2">did was we group together a lot<span style="s4"> of</span><span style="s3"> us</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">and we had an<span style="s4"> event</span> like<span style="s4"> I</span> said in</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.880" end="00:01:42.210" style="s2"><span style="s3">Inglewood</span> and the turnout was much</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">better than we thought there throughout</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.210" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">the day we&#39;ve had about 70 people come</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:48.259" style="s2">through most of which were from</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">communities around that area and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.259" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">organizations that are also in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">business of helping this process and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:58.409" style="s2">couple of the takeaways that we had</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:02:00.299" style="s2">first<span style="s4"> and</span> foremost was actually being on</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.409" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">the ground so to speak and not</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.299" end="00:02:04.920" style="s2"><span style="s4">necessarily</span> working in this building now</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">it was a great<span style="s3"> experience</span> for us it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.920" end="00:02:08.129" style="s2"><span style="s3">a</span><span style="s4"> great</span><span style="s3"> experience</span> to be with the people</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> are actually<span style="s4"> experiencing</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.129" end="00:02:13.870" style="s2">challenges they were trying<span style="s4"> to</span> fix it</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:15.010" style="s2">allows us<span style="s4"> to</span> get on a much deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.870" end="00:02:16.330" style="s2">what&#39;s important to them and<span style="s3"> the</span> actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.010" end="00:02:18.459" style="s2"><span style="s4">challenges</span> that they&#39;re facing because</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.330" end="00:02:19.690" style="s2">we found out ahead of time that<span style="s4"> a</span> lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.459" end="00:02:21.129" style="s2"><span style="s4">the</span> challenges<span style="s4"> that we thought they had</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:19.690" end="00:02:22.360" style="s2">were not and they had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.129" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">challenges that we didn&#39;t think<span style="s4"> about</span> in</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.360" end="00:02:26.860" style="s2">the<span style="s3"> first</span> place so it was a<span style="s3"> great</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:29.530" style="s2">education for us and helped us focus</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.860" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">moving<span style="s4"> forward</span> on to what we think based</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.530" end="00:02:33.180" style="s2">on what they&#39;re saying is important</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:35.170" style="s2">another couple<span style="s4"> takeaways</span> that we had</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.180" end="00:02:36.849" style="s2">many of the challenges that they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.170" end="00:02:41.500" style="s2">experiencing were around employment in</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.849" end="00:02:43.180" style="s2">education they spoke a lot to not having</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.500" end="00:02:47.200" style="s2">access to a lot of the<span style="s4"> resources</span> that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.180" end="00:02:48.549" style="s2">everyone thinks<span style="s3"> they</span> have so moving</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.200" end="00:02:50.140" style="s2">forward<span style="s3"> we&#39;re</span> going to be really</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.549" end="00:02:52.030" style="s2">focusing on these specific challenges</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.140" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">and working with<span style="s4"> these</span><span style="s3"> people</span> that<span style="s4"> we&#39;ve</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:02:55.840" style="s2">built<span style="s4"> relationships</span> with now and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:58.269" style="s2"><span style="s4">potentially</span> outsourcing some of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.840" end="00:03:01.090" style="s2">meetings to the angle would accelerator</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.269" end="00:03:03.579" style="s2">which<span style="s3"> is</span> where we hosted this event and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.090" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">one<span style="s3"> of</span> the other major takeaways was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.579" end="00:03:09.010" style="s2">mindset change that we at least myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:11.470" style="s2">experienced before hearing these</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.010" end="00:03:13.329" style="s2">people&#39;s stories again<span style="s4"> I&#39;ll</span> be the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.470" end="00:03:15.010" style="s2">to<span style="s4"> admit</span> that<span style="s4"> I</span> initially<span style="s3"> thought</span> well</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.329" end="00:03:16.329" style="s2">if somebody<span style="s4"> is</span> incarcerated as skids of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.010" end="00:03:18.370" style="s2">actions<span style="s3"> that</span> they did and it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.329" end="00:03:21.370" style="s2">choice but really<span style="s4"> the</span> truth is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.370" end="00:03:24.639" style="s2"><span style="s3">these</span> people are born<span style="s3"> into</span> a system that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.370" end="00:03:26.169" style="s2">they<span style="s4"> don&#39;t</span><span style="s3"> have</span> any<span style="s4"> resources</span> they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.639" end="00:03:27.400" style="s2">have any people around them they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.169" end="00:03:31.090" style="s2">have anyone to<span style="s4"> look</span> up to<span style="s4"> they</span> don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.400" end="00:03:33.639" style="s2">have there been basically born into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.090" end="00:03:35.620" style="s2">system<span style="s3"> that</span> you know they go back into</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.639" end="00:03:38.530" style="s2">car serration and come out<span style="s3"> and</span> go back</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.620" end="00:03:41.290" style="s2">and again so it definitely opened up a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.530" end="00:03:42.669" style="s2">lot<span style="s3"> of</span><span style="s4"> our</span> minds on what these people</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.290" end="00:03:44.709" style="s2">are experiencing and being able to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.669" end="00:03:48.040" style="s2">more empathetic towards what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.709" end="00:03:51.970" style="s2">facing and then the last<span style="s3"> takeaway</span> we had</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.040" end="00:03:53.260" style="s2">were how important it kind of reflects</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.970" end="00:03:55.209" style="s2">what we have here how important</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.260" end="00:03:56.530" style="s2">diversity is and not only diversity in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.209" end="00:03:57.849" style="s2">people&#39;s cultural backgrounds but</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.530" end="00:03:59.919" style="s2">diversity<span style="s4"> and</span> the experiences<span style="s4"> that</span> we</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.849" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">have the diversity and<span style="s4"> our</span> ideas<span style="s4"> our</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:59.919" end="00:04:03.699" style="s2"><span style="s4">challenges</span> that we face<span style="s3"> because</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:06.340" style="s2">cliche is diversity makes you stronger</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.699" end="00:04:08.410" style="s2">but that&#39;s the truth not only diversity</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.340" end="00:04:10.419" style="s2">and you know culture but also ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.410" end="00:04:12.430" style="s2">challenges that we&#39;re facing so with</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.419" end="00:04:14.889" style="s2">that being said we have<span style="s4"> tons</span> of ideas we</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.430" end="00:04:16.389" style="s2">love new people coming to our group and</p>
