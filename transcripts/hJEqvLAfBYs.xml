<p begin="00:37:06.950" end="00:37:10.850" style="s2">six actually broken up into seven</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.480" end="00:37:12.920" style="s2">modules so we started by releasing an</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.070" end="00:57:46.420" style="s2">we&#39;ve<span style="s4"> got</span> a lot you know we we have our</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.290" end="00:57:49.180" style="s2">share of those for sure our<span style="s4"> very</span> first</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.420" end="00:57:52.090" style="s2">year we had three teams one in Philly</p>

<p begin="00:57:52.090" end="00:57:58.450" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.710" end="00:58:00.460" style="s2">Seattle<span style="s4"> um</span> having really not succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.450" end="00:58:01.780" style="s2">there in our first year not because we</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.460" end="00:58:04.450" style="s2">didn&#39;t have<span style="s4"> great</span> fellows they were</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.100" end="00:58:10.960" style="s2">there was for clarity of focus there and</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.110" end="00:58:13.720" style="s2"><span style="s4">ultimately</span> um we were trying<span style="s3"> to</span> do a</p>

<p begin="00:58:13.720" end="00:58:17.170" style="s2">really learned over the years if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.460" end="00:58:19.540" style="s2">don&#39;t have a very specific problem that</p>

<p begin="00:58:19.540" end="00:58:26.100" style="s2">is as one of my mentors calls a hair on</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.510" end="00:58:28.150" style="s2">fire problem um like a general-purpose</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.100" end="00:58:30.940" style="s2">functionality for things like you<span style="s3"> know</span></p>
<p begin="00:58:28.150" end="00:58:34.140" style="s2">neighbors getting together is very<span style="s4"> hard</span></p>

<p begin="00:58:34.140" end="00:58:39.480" style="s2">solutions so having<span style="s3"> done</span> that in seattle</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.180" end="00:58:42.910" style="s2">now<span style="s4"> going</span> back and having a very very</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.480" end="00:58:48.370" style="s2">situated problem with clear outcomes and</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.910" end="00:58:52.630" style="s2">clear partners is it&#39;s a great do-over I</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.370" end="00:58:54.700" style="s2">think in other cases we we didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.630" end="00:58:56.830" style="s2">project in Albuquerque<span style="s3"> Leah</span> before last</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.700" end="00:59:01.090" style="s2">that also kind<span style="s4"> of</span> never really shift and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.830" end="00:59:04.750" style="s2">I think it was it struggled to find the</p>

<p begin="00:59:04.750" end="00:59:11.230" style="s2">would really have impact on the problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.310" end="00:59:13.270" style="s2">they were trying<span style="s4"> to solve and that</span></p>
<p begin="00:59:11.230" end="00:59:16.240" style="s2">probably accounts for a lot a lot<span style="s3"> of</span> the</p>

<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:35.370" style="s2">very often end up with projects that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.890" end="00:59:37.620" style="s2">succeed<span style="s3"> in</span> their local context but don&#39;t</p>
