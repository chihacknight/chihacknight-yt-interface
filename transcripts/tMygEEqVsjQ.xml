<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:54.510" style="s2">basically demand it from them and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.300" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">and they are<span style="s4"> legally</span> required to give it</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.330" end="00:01:31.320" style="s2">defined very closely and you know what</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.009" end="00:01:33.090" style="s2">we ended up doing was<span style="s4"> just</span> like reading</p>

<p begin="00:01:33.090" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">so I&#39;m going to<span style="s3"> like</span> use my<span style="s3"> favorite</span></p>

<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:56.579" style="s2">you go and like it may look daunting</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:01:58.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like a gray wall of text that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:01:58.110" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">like where people get turned off because</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.069" end="00:02:12.390" style="s2">just read through it and so if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:02:20.180" end="00:02:26.570" style="s2">like tenuous at best that their denial</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.600" end="00:02:28.520" style="s2">fits one of the seven exemptions you</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.570" end="00:02:31.670" style="s2">have<span style="s3"> legal</span> rights but you have to have</p>

<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:11.510" style="s2">basically like<span style="s4"> the</span> best<span style="s3"> FOIA</span> lawyer out</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.099" end="00:04:13.189" style="s2">there as<span style="s4"> far</span> as I&#39;m concerned I<span style="s4"> think</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:11.510" end="00:04:14.659" style="s2">there&#39;s probably<span style="s3"> someone</span> who works with</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.189" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">Jason Leopold out on the west coast</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.659" end="00:04:17.989" style="s2">who&#39;s pretty good but that&#39;s<span style="s3"> great</span> and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:19.729" style="s2">he lives in Chicago and he works for</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.989" end="00:04:21.560" style="s2"><span style="s3">this</span> firm lovi lovi it&#39;s a civil<span style="s3"> rights</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:19.729" end="00:04:24.139" style="s2">firm and the reason they took my case is</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.560" end="00:04:28.190" style="s2">because<span style="s3"> you</span> know they thought<span style="s3"> my</span> case</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.139" end="00:04:34.070" style="s2">was like of civil rights import you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.190" end="00:04:36.490" style="s2">I thought so too but crucially like they</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.070" end="00:04:42.110" style="s2">only take cases they think they can win</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.490" end="00:04:44.210" style="s2">because oftentimes the people who work</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.110" end="00:04:46.910" style="s2">with them don&#39;t have<span style="s4"> any</span> money to<span style="s3"> give</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:44.210" end="00:04:51.460" style="s2">them and that<span style="s3"> was</span> the<span style="s3"> case</span> with<span style="s4"> me</span> in</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.910" end="00:04:54.110" style="s2">this case you may be delighted to<span style="s3"> know</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:51.460" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2"><span style="s3">Illinois</span> law provides for attorneys fees</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.110" end="00:05:02.930" style="s2">if an attorney winds of FOIA case that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:04.460" style="s2">because if you win a civil suit against</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.930" end="00:05:06.680" style="s2"><span style="s3">the</span> government for<span style="s3"> not</span> following the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.460" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">FOIA law that means the government acted</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.680" end="00:05:11.990" style="s2">improperly so it stands to reason that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:13.550" style="s2">like you know they&#39;d provide attorneys</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.990" end="00:05:16.520" style="s2">fees and and it&#39;s a really<span style="s3"> cool</span> law</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.550" end="00:05:19.720" style="s2">because<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> self-selecting against</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.520" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">frivolous suits you know if attorneys</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.720" end="00:05:24.289" style="s2">are only going to get paid if they win</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:27.620" style="s2">they&#39;re only going to<span style="s4"> take</span> the cases</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.310" end="00:07:24.980" style="s2">that&#39;s part of that investigation well</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:27.050" style="s2">we we thought especially<span style="s4"> if</span> there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.540" end="00:12:23.559" style="s2"><span style="s3">like</span> thirty percent of requests are late</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.660" end="00:12:27.410" style="s2">which is technically against the law and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.559" end="00:12:32.470" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to parse it to see like</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.410" end="00:12:32.470" style="s2"><span style="s4">what</span> kinds<span style="s3"> of</span> requests are late</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.920" end="00:13:15.880" style="s2">in the middle of the<span style="s3"> street</span> and and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.950" end="00:13:19.630" style="s2">was caught on dashcam video and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.880" end="00:13:23.170" style="s2">worst part about it was that that all</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.630" end="00:13:26.670" style="s2">the news media reported the police line</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.170" end="00:13:30.400" style="s2">which is that which was at the time that</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.390" end="00:19:45.770" style="s2">of five FOIA requests each of those</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.130" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">taking a week or two but you know you</p>
