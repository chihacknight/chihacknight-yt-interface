<p begin="00:00:18.480" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">like five states is that right um so</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.810" end="00:00:26.310" style="s2">maybe I know one<span style="s4"> thing</span> yeah one<span style="s3"> threat</span></p>
<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed in all of<span style="s3"> this</span><span style="s4"> is</span> that like</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.310" end="00:00:30.150" style="s2">it seems like<span style="s3"> every</span> state does it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">differently it&#39;s like they<span style="s4"> have</span></p>
<p begin="00:00:30.150" end="00:00:34.230" style="s2">different<span style="s3"> rules</span> for like how<span style="s4"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">delegates or<span style="s3"> a</span> sign and all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.230" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">stuff um so it&#39;s these are the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">things that kind<span style="s3"> of</span> come up<span style="s3"> every so</span></p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:43.620" style="s2">often when there are elections happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">just how much<span style="s4"> of</span> a patchwork of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.620" end="00:00:48.600" style="s2">different systems and policies and ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">of collecting and running elections</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.600" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">happen every state gets to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:56.940" style="s2">decide their own rules and that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">kind of hard to figure out like who&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.940" end="00:01:01.829" style="s2">your<span style="s3"> ballot</span> in<span style="s3"> a</span> general way so this<span style="s3"> is</span></p>

<p begin="00:01:57.100" end="00:02:01.210" style="s2">that&#39;s based here in<span style="s4"> Chicago</span><span style="s3"> we</span> work</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.929" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">over in fulton market and our founding</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.210" end="00:02:07.479" style="s2">team actually<span style="s3"> moved</span> here to Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:11.019" style="s2">about a year<span style="s4"> ago</span> from DC we started down</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.479" end="00:02:13.510" style="s2">or up in 1871 before moving out to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.019" end="00:02:15.370" style="s2">Fulton market so it&#39;s<span style="s3"> really</span> nice to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.510" end="00:02:18.010" style="s2"><span style="s3">back</span> in<span style="s3"> this</span> building our<span style="s3"> mission</span> at</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.370" end="00:02:20.320" style="s2">ctcl is to increase<span style="s4"> Ifrit</span> participation</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.010" end="00:02:22.510" style="s2">by modernizing engagement between local</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.320" end="00:02:25.800" style="s2">government and the people they<span style="s4"> serve</span> and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.510" end="00:02:28.390" style="s2">we decided<span style="s4"> to</span> found the center because</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.800" end="00:02:30.640" style="s2">there was this really clear trend that</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.390" end="00:02:32.410" style="s2">the ways that we are connecting with one</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.640" end="00:02:34.329" style="s2">another and understanding the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.410" end="00:02:37.450" style="s2">around us and consuming information is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.329" end="00:02:39.549" style="s2">really technology driven and local</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.450" end="00:02:41.829" style="s2">government in particular is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.549" end="00:02:44.290" style="s2">lagging behind when it comes to being</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.829" end="00:02:45.610" style="s2">able<span style="s4"> to</span> adapt to this changing</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.290" end="00:02:48.390" style="s2">environment I&#39;m sure that that is no</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.610" end="00:02:51.130" style="s2">surprise to anybody here in the room and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.390" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">one of the<span style="s3"> things</span> that<span style="s3"> also</span> is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.130" end="00:02:54.519" style="s2"><span style="s3">clear</span><span style="s4"> from</span> the work that we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:56.860" style="s2">that by and large people who are working</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.519" end="00:02:58.660" style="s2">in local government are actually really</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.860" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2"><span style="s3">interested</span> in committed to doing a great</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.660" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">job it&#39;s not so much of sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:07.959" style="s2">willful desire to sort<span style="s3"> of</span> neglect</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.370" style="s2">adapting<span style="s3"> this</span> change but instead the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.959" end="00:03:10.810" style="s2"><span style="s4">oftentimes</span> folks aren&#39;t equipped with</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.370" end="00:03:13.720" style="s2">the skills or the resources to really</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.810" end="00:03:16.450" style="s2">effectively be more confident using</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.720" end="00:03:18.040" style="s2">technology and more effectively engaging</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.450" end="00:03:20.980" style="s2">with their community through more modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.040" end="00:03:23.489" style="s2">means and so that&#39;s why<span style="s4"> we</span> founded the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.980" end="00:03:25.720" style="s2">center right<span style="s4"> now</span> our<span style="s4"> work</span> is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.489" end="00:03:29.820" style="s2">particularly focused on the folks who</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.720" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">work in local<span style="s4"> elections</span> and and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.820" end="00:03:37.180" style="s2">helping<span style="s3"> to</span> provide data around elections</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:38.590" style="s2">so we do three main things to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.180" end="00:03:39.130" style="s2"><span style="s3">towards</span> our mission the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.590" end="00:03:40.780" style="s2">helping</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.130" end="00:03:42.940" style="s2">folks who are responsible for<span style="s4"> running</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:40.780" end="00:03:45.220" style="s2">local elections so county election</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.940" end="00:03:47.110" style="s2">administrators they might be auditors or</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.220" end="00:03:51.250" style="s2">recorders they take lots<span style="s3"> of</span> different</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.110" end="00:03:53.020" style="s2">hats<span style="s3"> clerks</span> here in<span style="s4"> Chicago</span> and we<span style="s3"> help</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:51.250" end="00:03:55.470" style="s2">to network them to share best practices</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.020" end="00:03:57.490" style="s2">and we also deliver trainings</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.470" end="00:04:00.670" style="s2">specifically on building skills around</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.490" end="00:04:02.530" style="s2"><span style="s4">technology</span> last year was the first year</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.670" end="00:04:04.570" style="s2">that we rolled out these trainings and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.530" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">we trained around<span style="s3"> 300</span> election officials</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.570" end="00:04:08.410" style="s2">across the country with a particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:11.440" style="s2">focus right now on help being officials</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.410" end="00:04:13.750" style="s2">learn how<span style="s3"> to</span> publish and maintain their</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.440" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">own website and that might seem<span style="s4"> like</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:13.750" end="00:04:17.920" style="s2">something that&#39;s relatively simple but</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:20.140" style="s2">one data point that really stuck sticks</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.920" end="00:04:23.890" style="s2">out to us is<span style="s3"> that</span> about a third of the</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.810" end="00:04:31.240" style="s2">means<span style="s4"> that</span> for you know those 966</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.910" end="00:23:59.280" style="s2"><span style="s3">photos</span><span style="s4"> and</span> then there are places like</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.030" end="00:24:17.400" style="s2">fields across Twitter files which<span style="s3"> is</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:13.860" end="00:24:19.470" style="s2">also<span style="s3"> very</span> valuable to<span style="s3"> us</span> but it is not a</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.820" end="00:24:30.630" style="s2">a campaigns world to sort of get into<span style="s3"> I</span></p>

<p begin="00:24:35.340" end="00:24:39.240" style="s2">things because they have lots<span style="s3"> of</span></p>

<p begin="00:25:07.950" end="00:25:12.570" style="s2">histories as you might imagine the data</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.860" end="00:25:14.220" style="s2">in a voter file is particularly valuable</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.570" end="00:25:16.380" style="s2">to people running<span style="s4"> for</span> office and so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.220" end="00:25:17.940" style="s2"><span style="s3">biggest</span> effort to sort democratize voter</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.909" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">so school districts yes and no we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.919" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">going<span style="s3"> to</span> hopefully by the end of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:39.220" style="s2">november have a much better handle on</p>

<p begin="00:25:41.320" end="00:25:45.220" style="s2">some<span style="s3"> places</span> are nicely delineate it in</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.750" end="00:25:46.899" style="s2">some places<span style="s4"> like</span> the state<span style="s4"> of</span> Arizona</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.220" end="00:25:50.500" style="s2">has like 15 counties and somehow like</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.899" end="00:25:51.700" style="s2"><span style="s3">2000</span> elected school districts so we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.500" end="00:25:53.049" style="s2"><span style="s4">working</span> on building that up right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.700" end="00:25:55.080" style="s2">but<span style="s4"> right now we&#39;re foot we&#39;re trying to</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:53.049" end="00:25:58.539" style="s2">focus on just the core sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.080" end="00:25:59.860" style="s2">constitutional and legit of districts we</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.539" end="00:26:01.559" style="s2">do have some judicial districts they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.860" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">going to be getting loaded in very soon</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.559" end="00:26:11.470" style="s2">and like I said we&#39;re also trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:13.630" style="s2">more special districts<span style="s4"> so</span> try at<span style="s3"> least</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:11.470" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">in the first batch I would imagine<span style="s4"> we</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:13.630" end="00:26:17.559" style="s2">will<span style="s3"> be</span> focusing on the folks that would</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:19.000" style="s2">have elected school boards because a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.559" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">primary use case for this data is then</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.000" end="00:26:21.700" style="s2">displaying who would be running for<span style="s3"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:24.850" style="s2">school board office who would be elected</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.380" end="00:26:29.350" style="s2">same place<span style="s3"> for</span> as an elected school</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.029" end="00:26:31.029" style="s2">board versus a non elected school board</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.350" end="00:26:32.350" style="s2">we would load both in who wouldn&#39;t sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.029" end="00:26:35.490" style="s2">of go<span style="s4"> out</span> of our way to hunt down the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.350" end="00:26:35.490" style="s2">elected school board if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.460" end="00:26:48.070" style="s2">so there so yeah there are a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.940" end="00:26:49.990" style="s2">different<span style="s3"> data</span> providers that go into</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.070" end="00:26:51.130" style="s2">these api&#39;s obviously<span style="s4"> because</span> there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.130" end="00:26:54.370" style="s2">and so we are one<span style="s4"> of</span> the main providers</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.350" end="00:26:56.140" style="s2">in terms of like baseline information</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.370" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">that information gets supplemented and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.140" end="00:26:59.320" style="s2">swooped around in a lot<span style="s4"> of different</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:03.520" style="s2">ways one<span style="s3"> of</span> the big relationships we</p>

<p begin="00:27:03.520" end="00:27:07.179" style="s2">work closely with the voting information</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.750" end="00:27:08.890" style="s2"><span style="s3">project</span> which does is a project of the</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.789" end="00:27:19.720" style="s2">you will see where you go vote and who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:29.020" style="s2">we&#39;re<span style="s3"> really</span> happy when it does because</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.820" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">I mean their data is interoperable and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.020" end="00:27:34.890" style="s2">we would like people to the user data</p>
