<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">one thing and that&#39;s lobby city council</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">for a one client and that&#39;s apps me and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2"><span style="s3">council</span> 31 so we are one<span style="s4"> of</span> the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:47.789" style="s2">labor unions in the state most people</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">know us right now because of us being</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.789" end="00:01:52.979" style="s2">the largest state employee union and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:55.890" style="s2">that budget impasse and the contract we</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.979" end="00:01:59.220" style="s2">don&#39;t have with the governor yet but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.890" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">do i do City Council lobbying I lobby</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">level but for tonight&#39;s purposes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">going to focus on City Council the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:14.489" style="s2">easiest way to explain what<span style="s4"> I</span> do is I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:16.709" style="s2">look at budgets I look at<span style="s3"> legislation</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:14.489" end="00:02:19.940" style="s2">that comes out I look at what the impact</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.709" end="00:02:24.360" style="s2">on our members is going to be I<span style="s3"> talk to</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:19.940" end="00:02:28.019" style="s2">alderman or state reps whoever about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.360" end="00:02:31.049" style="s2">impact on our members<span style="s3"> and</span> then when</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.019" end="00:02:33.390" style="s2">they&#39;re great with us I hope<span style="s3"> that</span> they</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.049" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">and help that they get reelected and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.390" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">when they&#39;re not sometimes we support</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:41.070" style="s2">candidates against them and I<span style="s4"> help</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:43.500" style="s2">coordinate our members against them so</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.070" end="00:02:46.470" style="s2"><span style="s3">it&#39;s</span> kind of a really three-pronged</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.500" end="00:02:49.769" style="s2">strategy on what I do and I say that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.470" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">because not<span style="s4"> all</span> lobbyists do all those</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.769" end="00:02:54.600" style="s2">things and because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.410" end="00:02:56.940" style="s2">particularly important for the work that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.600" end="00:03:02.519" style="s2">I do that I have my hands in all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.940" end="00:03:05.100" style="s2">those pots so when people ask me about</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.519" end="00:03:06.780" style="s2">being<span style="s3"> a</span> lobbyist because often they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.100" end="00:03:09.329" style="s2">surprised when I tell<span style="s4"> them</span> that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:12.269" style="s2">do the question that I get asked the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.329" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">most is well what&#39;s your<span style="s3"> biggest</span> win or</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.269" end="00:03:17.820" style="s2">what&#39;s<span style="s3"> the</span> most important piece of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:19.560" style="s2">legislation that you&#39;ve passed and until</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.820" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">this year I didn&#39;t really<span style="s4"> have</span> an answer</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.560" end="00:03:25.530" style="s2">because<span style="s3"> we</span> play a lot of defense that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:29.700" style="s2">asked me and but this year we had a big</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:11.080" style="s2">responsive maybe it wasn&#39;t enough<span style="s3"> to</span> say</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.890" end="00:13:12.670" style="s2">I have the support<span style="s4"> of</span> the mayor they</p>

<p begin="00:13:12.670" end="00:13:25.900" style="s2">to<span style="s3"> stand</span> for more dramatic<span style="s4"> lighting</span> it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.150" end="00:13:28.450" style="s2">because I mentioned the mayor um yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.900" end="00:13:30.820" style="s2"><span style="s4">think</span> that that kind<span style="s3"> of</span> made people pay</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.450" end="00:13:32.760" style="s2">attention<span style="s4"> and</span> like it was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.820" end="00:13:36.930" style="s2">because all of the alderman Sawyer</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.760" end="00:13:42.360" style="s2">there&#39;s being in the Progressive Caucus</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.930" end="00:13:44.650" style="s2">and then and in the<span style="s3"> Black</span> Caucus I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.360" end="00:13:46.510" style="s2">before<span style="s3"> the</span> elections there were a number</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.650" end="00:13:47.589" style="s2">of aldermen that we&#39;re looking<span style="s3"> at</span> him</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.589" end="00:13:52.210" style="s2">stepping out too far and then there was</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.770" end="00:13:56.170" style="s2">kind of a wave of more progressive</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.210" end="00:13:58.600" style="s2">alderman that got elected<span style="s3"> and</span> none of</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.600" end="00:14:04.839" style="s2"><span style="s4">running</span> for<span style="s3"> alderman</span> lost so I think<span style="s4"> him</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:01.839" end="00:14:07.810" style="s2">getting elected black caucus chair kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.839" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">of shows how how folks mindsets were</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.810" end="00:14:12.220" style="s2">changing a little bit and<span style="s4"> then</span> when you</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:46.810" style="s2">there there&#39;s going<span style="s4"> to</span> be a huge change</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.980" end="00:14:48.610" style="s2">or a huge backlash for the mayor I just</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.589" end="00:15:31.000" style="s2">I should also say I think<span style="s3"> another</span> factor</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.510" end="00:15:33.459" style="s2">and that question of<span style="s4"> Independence</span> will</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.649" end="00:21:05.559" style="s2">actually the hardest question I got</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.389" end="00:21:13.019" style="s2">because I do use<span style="s4"> um</span> like I use the</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.490" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">question Steve I&#39;m always excited to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.190" end="00:22:17.179" style="s2">what people<span style="s4"> are</span> doing<span style="s3"> with</span> the data</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:22.789" style="s2">particularly at the city that comes out</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.179" end="00:22:25.639" style="s2">I think<span style="s4"> the</span> mapping stuff that WBZ did</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.789" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">around like 911 phone calls and mental</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.639" end="00:22:30.249" style="s2">health and stuff like that that comes</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:32.450" style="s2">out occasionally is really good</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.249" end="00:22:36.259" style="s2">particularly because I<span style="s4"> think</span> a<span style="s4"> lot</span> of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.450" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">the<span style="s3"> aldermen</span> just may not know how</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.259" end="00:22:43.159" style="s2">different<span style="s3"> city</span> policies are impact their</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:46.669" style="s2">own board until other people share that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.159" end="00:22:48.679" style="s2">information with them but yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.669" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">not one data set that I&#39;ve been<span style="s3"> looking</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:48.679" end="00:22:56.740" style="s2"><span style="s4">for</span> that that&#39;s not exist so with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:56.740" style="s2">I&#39;ll open up there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.740" end="00:23:08.340" style="s2">campaign</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.690" end="00:23:14.150" style="s2">the second piece what are the other</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.340" end="00:23:14.150" style="s2">inputs that politicians are taking it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.130" end="00:23:21.870" style="s2">yeah okay so the<span style="s4"> first</span> question where</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.350" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">does the money go we cut checks to their</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.870" end="00:23:29.940" style="s2">campaign funds and sometimes it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:32.460" style="s2">specific ask you know leading up<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:29.940" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">during elections it&#39;s that&#39;s when we</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.460" end="00:23:39.179" style="s2">give our biggest checks and usually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:41.460" style="s2">because we know very specifically what</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.179" end="00:23:43.700" style="s2">they&#39;re going to spend it on and in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.460" end="00:23:48.330" style="s2">same way that I don&#39;t like spending on</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.700" end="00:23:49.890" style="s2">their meals in a macro away the union</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.330" end="00:23:51.720" style="s2">would like to know when we give someone</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.890" end="00:23:55.590" style="s2">a five-thousand-dollar check it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.720" end="00:23:58.440" style="s2">just I I mean some of<span style="s4"> them</span> maybe use</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.590" end="00:24:01.289" style="s2">their our money to do passing which i</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.440" end="00:24:04.500" style="s2">think is like I&#39;m not from Chicago so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.289" end="00:24:07.230" style="s2">didn&#39;t do like pole passing it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.500" end="00:24:08.970" style="s2"><span style="s3">like</span><span style="s4"> a</span> waste of<span style="s4"> money</span> to<span style="s4"> me</span> but oh the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.230" end="00:24:11.460" style="s2">when you go vote sometimes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.970" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">people standing out<span style="s3"> they</span> have a card</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.460" end="00:24:16.200" style="s2">that says punch whatever in their name</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:18.600" style="s2">like as if you didn&#39;t know who you were</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.200" end="00:24:20.549" style="s2">going<span style="s4"> to</span> vote for when you arrived but</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.600" end="00:24:23.400" style="s2">it&#39;s the<span style="s4"> throwback</span> from the Machine days</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.549" end="00:24:25.710" style="s2">when you know that person you know your</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.400" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">precinct person was giving you the list</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.710" end="00:24:32.630" style="s2">of who to vote for but I<span style="s3"> think</span> it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:34.860" style="s2"><span style="s3">little</span> less effective now but but</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.630" end="00:24:36.539" style="s2">usually we we<span style="s3"> want</span> to know what our</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.860" end="00:24:39.059" style="s2">money is going towards and we want to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.539" end="00:24:42.230" style="s2">know as an effective means of spending</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.059" end="00:24:46.770" style="s2"><span style="s4">the</span> money but its campaign funds and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.230" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">then the second question around what</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.770" end="00:24:54.659" style="s2">other inputs a lot<span style="s3"> of</span> times I<span style="s4"> think</span> it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:57.000" style="s2">random constituents that may weigh in on</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.659" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">something and and that&#39;s seriously the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.000" end="00:25:03.419" style="s2">most effective I mean I<span style="s4"> think</span> for me<span style="s3"> as</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:05.460" style="s2">a lobbyist who has represents like</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:16.110" style="s2">when I have a member that lives in their</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.880" end="00:25:24.050" style="s2">about how they&#39;re impacted by it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.770" end="00:25:26.960" style="s2">they say you know and<span style="s3"> I</span> live in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.050" end="00:25:29.750" style="s2">ward that&#39;s because they would rather</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.960" end="00:25:33.110" style="s2">not tell someone who&#39;s voting for them</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.750" end="00:25:36.460" style="s2">or not that they don&#39;t<span style="s3"> want</span> to do what</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.990" end="00:25:51.380" style="s2">and on that I would say that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.800" end="00:25:55.250" style="s2">are really<span style="s3"> useful</span> during<span style="s4"> apps</span> me is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.380" end="00:25:59.150" style="s2">really useful during budget time I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.250" end="00:26:00.950" style="s2">a<span style="s3"> lot</span> of<span style="s3"> what</span> I do is analyzing I look</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.870" end="00:27:48.210" style="s2">levels but it&#39;s um given the history and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.510" end="00:27:51.480" style="s2">even there&#39;s been indictments since I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.210" end="00:27:53.940" style="s2">been around like you should know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.480" end="00:27:57.230" style="s2">I mean<span style="s4"> there&#39;s</span> ways to ask me for<span style="s3"> money</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:53.940" end="00:27:59.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s<span style="s3"> completely</span> legal but perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.230" end="00:28:02.279" style="s2">doing it at City Hall right<span style="s3"> after</span> you</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.940" end="00:28:04.500" style="s2">signed on to a bill and saying that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.279" end="00:28:11.549" style="s2">that&#39;s why you signed on to my bill<span style="s4"> is</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:04.500" end="00:28:14.039" style="s2">not<span style="s3"> a</span> good idea yeah you face a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.549" end="00:28:15.929" style="s2">opposition or oxygen money in particular</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.039" end="00:28:21.029" style="s2">when you were working on passing the PTA</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.929" end="00:28:22.649" style="s2">oh um no not really<span style="s3"> I</span> mean<span style="s3"> I</span> think and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.029" end="00:28:24.870" style="s2">can everybody hear the question the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.649" end="00:28:28.559" style="s2">question was was their opposition money</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.870" end="00:28:30.120" style="s2">or opposition organized opposition when</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.559" end="00:28:35.340" style="s2">we were trying<span style="s4"> to</span> pass the privatization</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.120" end="00:28:38.940" style="s2"><span style="s3">ordinance</span> they the problem was<span style="s3"> I</span> think</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.340" end="00:28:41.580" style="s2">most<span style="s3"> city council bills there&#39;s not</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.940" end="00:28:43.860" style="s2">lot that are contentious in like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.580" end="00:28:47.549" style="s2">sense of there&#39;s two warring factions</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.860" end="00:28:51.539" style="s2">and like that&#39;s not so much or at least</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.549" end="00:28:55.169" style="s2"><span style="s3">not</span> as much as Springfield but</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.539" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2"><span style="s4">oftentimes</span> it&#39;s<span style="s3"> just</span> that people put out</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.169" end="00:29:02.460" style="s2">ideas and then nothing happens so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:05.940" style="s2">fight for us was to keep it relevant on</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.460" end="00:29:06.540" style="s2">people&#39;s minds and keep<span style="s3"> people</span> from</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.940" end="00:29:10.410" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.540" end="00:29:12.420" style="s2">that it was dead um and and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.410" end="00:29:16.740" style="s2">the biggest thing and the<span style="s4"> reason</span> was</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.420" end="00:29:20.250" style="s2">because there was no movement and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.740" end="00:29:24.180" style="s2">administration wanted<span style="s4"> to</span> wait for<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:20.250" end="00:29:26.700" style="s2"><span style="s4">right</span> time or you know I mean and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.180" end="00:29:31.670" style="s2">think they<span style="s4"> wanted to see a fit if it</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:26.700" end="00:29:34.770" style="s2">would just go away there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.670" end="00:29:39.360" style="s2">discussion during the negotiations about</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.770" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">what was feasible to expect and<span style="s3"> you</span> know</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.360" end="00:29:45.180" style="s2">we had a kind<span style="s3"> of</span> low threshold when we</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.520" end="00:29:47.700" style="s2">first started<span style="s3"> and</span> there was questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.180" end="00:29:51.030" style="s2">about whether that was a good<span style="s4"> thing</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:47.700" end="00:29:53.310" style="s2">whether we should you know construction</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.030" end="00:29:54.450" style="s2">projects would fall under that whether</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.310" end="00:29:56.250" style="s2">there should be a different threshold</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.450" end="00:29:59.160" style="s2">for them or whether they should be</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.250" end="00:30:01.290" style="s2">exempted so there was a lot of back and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.160" end="00:30:04.710" style="s2">forth about things once we got to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.290" end="00:30:07.170" style="s2">table but it was keeping<span style="s3"> it</span> relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.710" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">keeping people from thinking oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.170" end="00:30:13.620" style="s2">that&#39;s<span style="s3"> not</span> happening that that<span style="s3"> was</span> a big</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:15.750" style="s2">problem<span style="s3"> and</span> I mean there&#39;s a lot<span style="s4"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:30:13.620" end="00:30:19.640" style="s2">stuff<span style="s4"> that</span> gets introduced in<span style="s3"> City</span></p>
<p begin="00:30:15.750" end="00:30:24.270" style="s2"><span style="s3">Council</span> some of it good some of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.640" end="00:30:26.040" style="s2">random but a lot of stuff just ends up</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.270" end="00:30:28.170" style="s2">in rules or even gets<span style="s4"> sent to a</span></p>
<p begin="00:30:26.040" end="00:30:30.240" style="s2">committee<span style="s3"> and</span> just doesn&#39;t<span style="s3"> ever</span> get</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.170" end="00:30:34.230" style="s2">heard there&#39;s a<span style="s3"> lot</span> of stuff<span style="s4"> that</span> gets</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:36.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just<span style="s3"> sitting</span> in committee so so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.230" end="00:30:40.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the big<span style="s3"> problem</span> some of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.600" end="00:30:44.820" style="s2">personally some people just<span style="s4"> introduced</span></p>
<p begin="00:30:40.680" end="00:30:49.700" style="s2">legislation may be a good<span style="s3"> idea</span> but may</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.820" end="00:30:52.140" style="s2">not really<span style="s3"> work</span> it and so you have five</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.700" end="00:30:55.320" style="s2">people that sit closest to you sign a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.140" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">bill and it gets assigned to a committee</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.320" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s not<span style="s3"> getting</span> hurt then people</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:03.660" style="s2">aren&#39;t trying<span style="s3"> to</span> get more co-sponsors or</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:05.970" style="s2">doing press or a lot of the legwork that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.660" end="00:31:09.210" style="s2">it takes to actually get the<span style="s3"> thing</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:05.970" end="00:31:12.420" style="s2">passed so that&#39;s why a lot of things SE</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.210" end="00:31:13.890" style="s2">fala<span style="s3"> to</span> it&#39;s not necessarily a malicious</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.420" end="00:31:15.270" style="s2">thing but just since it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.890" end="00:31:19.580" style="s2">automatically go through the process</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.270" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span><span style="s4"> not</span> being debated</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.580" end="00:31:27.260" style="s2">yeah do you think that the<span style="s4"> City</span> Council</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:30.620" style="s2">members might be receptive<span style="s4"> to</span> something</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.260" end="00:31:32.420" style="s2"><span style="s3">from</span> us that that<span style="s3"> helps</span> them kind<span style="s3"> of</span> sit</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.620" end="00:31:33.590" style="s2">for information or something that<span style="s3"> they</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:32.420" end="00:31:35.720" style="s2">would either be a resource that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.590" end="00:31:38.900" style="s2">could use it they could like post or</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.720" end="00:31:42.530" style="s2">have<span style="s3"> posted</span><span style="s4"> more</span> constituents<span style="s3"> or</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:38.900" end="00:31:48.200" style="s2">something absolutely I so I think<span style="s3"> one</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:42.530" end="00:31:49.970" style="s2">pagers are God like like that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.200" end="00:31:53.870" style="s2">only way you&#39;re going to get people that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.970" end="00:31:57.320" style="s2"><span style="s3">like</span> even really start to look at what</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.870" end="00:31:59.750" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about I&#39;d say sit<span style="s4"> down</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:57.320" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">and have a few targeted meetings with</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.750" end="00:32:05.050" style="s2">people that might be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:08.060" style="s2">whatever it is that you&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.050" end="00:32:10.760" style="s2">either based off of who your alderman is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.060" end="00:32:14.360" style="s2">or if they&#39;ve expressed interest in an</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.760" end="00:32:17.150" style="s2">issue before so that you have like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.360" end="00:32:18.950" style="s2">champion someone that<span style="s3"> can</span> advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.150" end="00:32:21.950" style="s2">you that can be<span style="s4"> a</span> resource for other</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.950" end="00:32:26.600" style="s2">Alderman&#39;s to talk to them about it or</p>

<p begin="00:32:28.940" end="00:32:35.540" style="s2">them understand why data is important</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.580" end="00:32:38.090" style="s2">and now they have<span style="s3"> a</span> link to this open</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.540" end="00:32:41.480" style="s2">source whatever on their site you can go</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.090" end="00:32:43.880" style="s2">look and and just having an example of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.480" end="00:32:47.630" style="s2">it&#39;s been done somebody else did<span style="s4"> it</span></p>
<p begin="00:32:43.880" end="00:32:50.330" style="s2">before it&#39;s not the revolution like</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.630" end="00:32:53.300" style="s2">we&#39;ll just help that get<span style="s3"> that</span> process</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.330" end="00:32:55.250" style="s2">started and if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.300" end="00:32:57.380" style="s2">specific we can talk afterwards and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.250" end="00:33:04.060" style="s2">can maybe tell you like oh I think<span style="s4"> this</span></p>
<p begin="00:32:57.380" end="00:33:04.060" style="s2">alderman would be willing to do that yep</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.500" end="00:33:09.530" style="s2">calm down</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.960" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">yes<span style="s3"> I</span> do think the alderman could do</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.810" end="00:33:21.490" style="s2">stuff um I I mean so I worked for a city</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:26.560" style="s2">councilperson Atlanta when I was<span style="s3"> in</span></p>
<p begin="00:33:21.490" end="00:33:30.040" style="s2">college and<span style="s3"> then</span> I I lived in Minnesota</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.560" end="00:33:32.290" style="s2">during grad school so like the City</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.040" end="00:33:35.800" style="s2">Council experiences I had before<span style="s4"> or</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.290" end="00:33:37.810" style="s2">little different but um and I<span style="s3"> think</span></p>
<p begin="00:33:35.800" end="00:33:40.300" style="s2">there&#39;s not so much of a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.810" end="00:33:44.560" style="s2">doing it here but I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.300" end="00:33:47.950" style="s2">possible I just think that it&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.560" end="00:33:52.020" style="s2">it depends on who you are<span style="s4"> going</span><span style="s3"> to</span> and<span style="s3"> I</span></p>
<p begin="00:33:47.950" end="00:33:55.240" style="s2">would<span style="s3"> say</span> choose your sponsor carefully</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.020" end="00:33:57.460" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know<span style="s4"> even</span> in Springfield</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.240" end="00:34:01.300" style="s2">where there&#39;s more of a culture of doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.460" end="00:34:04.750" style="s2">that who&#39;s your sponsor carefully be</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.300" end="00:34:08.250" style="s2">very clear of what your expectations are</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.750" end="00:34:13.150" style="s2">have a plan so you can help<span style="s3"> guide</span> them</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.250" end="00:34:16.570" style="s2">have grassroots support so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.150" end="00:34:18.310" style="s2">more than just<span style="s3"> one</span> person coming and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.570" end="00:34:20.230" style="s2">talking<span style="s3"> to</span> them about it make sure</p>
