<p begin="00:23:00.959" end="00:23:06.449" style="s2">this<span style="s4"> is</span> our North Star we need to figure</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.669" end="00:23:09.239" style="s2">out<span style="s3"> how</span><span style="s4"> to</span> get there right so what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.449" end="00:23:13.079" style="s2">think is a key to this is data systems</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.239" end="00:23:16.169" style="s2">as Amy mentioned with that hodgepodge</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.079" end="00:23:18.419" style="s2">shows five entities those funders data</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.169" end="00:23:21.269" style="s2">is distributed across hundreds of data</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.419" end="00:23:23.999" style="s2">systems and in formats and in a posture</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.269" end="00:23:26.669" style="s2">that&#39;s primarily focused on collecting</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.999" end="00:23:29.729" style="s2">outputs right so what we&#39;re<span style="s4"> looking</span> to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.669" end="00:23:31.069" style="s2">do is develop or develop combination of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.729" end="00:23:32.639" style="s2">people process and technology</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.069" end="00:23:35.729" style="s2">everybody&#39;s three favorite word&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.639" end="00:23:37.409" style="s2">probably in<span style="s3"> this</span> room to support the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.729" end="00:23:40.289" style="s2">organizational data capabilities in</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.409" end="00:23:42.899" style="s2">usage so when you look at this this<span style="s4"> is</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:40.289" end="00:23:44.579" style="s2">the ideal state right we have a data</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.899" end="00:23:45.839" style="s2">dictionary that&#39;s defining the data that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.579" end="00:23:49.589" style="s2"><span style="s3">we&#39;re</span> collecting we have our data</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.839" end="00:23:51.809" style="s2">sources on<span style="s4"> the</span> left right data is moving</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.589" end="00:23:54.359" style="s2">through our ETL layer into a data</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.809" end="00:23:58.889" style="s2">warehouse into that vision visualization</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.359" end="00:24:01.890" style="s2">layer and we learn this<span style="s3"> is</span> what we want</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.889" end="00:24:04.830" style="s2">to do and this is what we&#39;re hoping I</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.890" end="00:24:06.240" style="s2">that<span style="s3"> this</span> diagram is<span style="s4"> probably</span> common and</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.830" end="00:24:08.190" style="s2">it probably<span style="s3"> could</span> be used in many</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:10.050" style="s2">different instances although maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.190" end="00:24:15.770" style="s2">with a<span style="s4"> harpoon Alliance color Brandon</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:10.050" end="00:24:18.570" style="s2">but um this is the<span style="s3"> ideal</span> state right but</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.770" end="00:24:20.970" style="s2">even<span style="s4"> if</span> this diagram is<span style="s3"> common</span> we do</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.570" end="00:24:22.890" style="s2">have our own unique challenges and those</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.970" end="00:24:27.960" style="s2">unique challenges are that<span style="s3"> almost</span> none</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.890" end="00:24:30.900" style="s2"><span style="s4">of</span> it exists at our alliance so if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.960" end="00:24:32.670" style="s2">look at this data flow knowledge flow</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.900" end="00:24:36.690" style="s2">not really working too well and a lot<span style="s4"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:32.670" end="00:24:39.210" style="s2"><span style="s3">vaporware up there but um so so</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:36.690" end="00:24:41.400" style="s2">underneath those five organizations we</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.210" end="00:24:43.860" style="s2">have somewhere upwards of 110 programs</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.400" end="00:24:47.610" style="s2">those 110 programs have their 110</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.860" end="00:24:50.790" style="s2">funders plus right so all of<span style="s3"> that</span> data</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.610" end="00:24:52.740" style="s2">collection is happening for them and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.790" end="00:24:55.590" style="s2">also don&#39;t necessarily have a system of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.740" end="00:24:59.970" style="s2">record for some of those programs Excel</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.590" end="00:25:05.100" style="s2">access PDF files these types of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.970" end="00:25:10.170" style="s2">right so they&#39;re not systems<span style="s3"> and</span> in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.100" end="00:25:12.380" style="s2">addition<span style="s3"> to</span> that we have the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.170" end="00:25:15.240" style="s2">of operating in five different</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.380" end="00:25:18.030" style="s2">industries right so the services that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.240" end="00:25:20.910" style="s2"><span style="s3">provide</span> range from law firms to property</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.030" end="00:25:23.010" style="s2">developers to<span style="s4"> healthcare</span> providers how</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.910" end="00:25:24.840" style="s2">do<span style="s3"> you</span> find a single<span style="s3"> system</span> or a data</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.010" end="00:25:29.040" style="s2">system of Records for all of those</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.840" end="00:25:31.020" style="s2">organizations right and lastly this data</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.040" end="00:25:33.210" style="s2">infrastructure bi infrastructure just</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.020" end="00:25:34.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist at all so this<span style="s4"> is</span><span style="s3"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:33.210" end="00:25:35.820" style="s2">challenge<span style="s4"> that</span> we&#39;re facing and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.620" end="00:25:39.090" style="s2">we&#39;re trying<span style="s3"> to</span> work through right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.820" end="00:25:41.580" style="s2">so where are we<span style="s4"> at</span> right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.090" end="00:25:43.710" style="s2">making a<span style="s3"> map</span><span style="s4"> aha</span> this is middle-earth we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.580" end="00:25:45.450" style="s2">could have used Westeros but I<span style="s3"> think</span> you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.710" end="00:25:47.250" style="s2">get the point here we&#39;re<span style="s3"> trying to get</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.450" end="00:25:50.580" style="s2">sense and get our bearings of where and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.250" end="00:25:52.200" style="s2">how<span style="s3"> to</span> approach this challenge right but</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.580" end="00:25:53.850" style="s2">we do think that it&#39;s a worthy endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.200" end="00:25:55.740" style="s2">even if you look back at that other</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.850" end="00:25:57.300" style="s2">slide and see that there&#39;s so much work</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.740" end="00:25:58.980" style="s2">to do because<span style="s3"> of</span><span style="s4"> the</span> breadth of<span style="s3"> our</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:57.300" end="00:26:01.380" style="s2">services we feel like we have a unique</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.980" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">data opportunity to uncover something</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.380" end="00:26:06.150" style="s2">and<span style="s3"> truly</span> innovate in the industry that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2"><span style="s3">we&#39;re</span> in right so we think<span style="s4"> that</span> moving</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.150" end="00:26:10.140" style="s2">from outputs to outcomes is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:12.120" style="s2">something<span style="s3"> that</span> we&#39;re<span style="s3"> going</span><span style="s4"> to</span><span style="s3"> be</span> able<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:10.140" end="00:26:13.590" style="s2">do we think<span style="s4"> that</span> those outcomes combined</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.120" end="00:26:15.690" style="s2">together going<span style="s3"> to</span> be able<span style="s3"> to</span> show how we</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.590" end="00:26:17.399" style="s2">are impacting communities we</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.690" end="00:26:21.629" style="s2">so think that<span style="s3"> we&#39;ll</span> be<span style="s3"> able</span> to uncover</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.399" end="00:26:23.250" style="s2">the mix of services that will move the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.629" end="00:26:25.049" style="s2">needle the most for ending poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.250" end="00:26:26.940" style="s2">we think that our data systems will</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.049" end="00:26:29.299" style="s2">allow us to actually connect people more</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.940" end="00:26:32.340" style="s2">quickly to move them through those</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.299" end="00:26:36.090" style="s2">services so we<span style="s4"> think</span> we have<span style="s3"> a</span> unique</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.340" end="00:26:39.179" style="s2">opportunity given given that breadth of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.090" end="00:26:41.190" style="s2">service so the things<span style="s3"> that</span> are keeping</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.179" end="00:26:42.690" style="s2">us up at night right now are the key</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.190" end="00:26:45.690" style="s2">questions as we try to start moving</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.690" end="00:26:47.190" style="s2">through this process is<span style="s3"> just</span> really what</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.690" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">can<span style="s3"> we</span> learn from other industries that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.190" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">are maybe further along<span style="s3"> in the</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:56.009" style="s2">innovation<span style="s3"> and learning aspects that</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:57.629" style="s2">their maturation our challenge<span style="s4"> is</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:56.009" end="00:27:00.600" style="s2">actually different or the same than</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.629" end="00:27:02.399" style="s2">those industries right and what can we</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.600" end="00:27:03.779" style="s2"><span style="s3">do</span> now<span style="s3"> because we know</span> that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.399" end="00:27:06.269" style="s2">vaporware is going to take a long time</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.779" end="00:27:08.340" style="s2"><span style="s4">to</span> build what can<span style="s3"> we</span> do with the data</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.269" end="00:27:09.990" style="s2">sets that we have right now<span style="s3"> to</span> begin in</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.340" end="00:27:11.220" style="s2">to jumpstart that innovation and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.990" end="00:27:13.080" style="s2">understanding and learning what</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.220" end="00:27:14.429" style="s2">opportunities do we have what tools<span style="s4"> are</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:13.080" end="00:27:18.299" style="s2">already out there that are available for</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.429" end="00:27:19.980" style="s2">us and then lastly when is enough on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.299" end="00:27:22.980" style="s2">planning and when<span style="s3"> can</span> we just start</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.980" end="00:27:25.320" style="s2">doing so you know this<span style="s4"> is</span> a little<span style="s3"> bit</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:22.980" end="00:27:26.639" style="s2">of tour and understanding<span style="s3"> of</span> what we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:27:30.899" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">just therapy for you and me is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.549" end="00:27:37.470" style="s2">right I think we needed<span style="s3"> somebody</span> to</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.610" end="00:28:08.279" style="s2">that said we have explored and talks a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.889" end="00:28:10.940" style="s2">lot about<span style="s4"> long-term</span> vision once<span style="s4"> we</span> get</p>

<p begin="00:38:49.230" end="00:38:55.299" style="s2">great<span style="s3"> question</span> yeah I wonder if anything</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.410" end="00:38:57.849" style="s2">in the field is<span style="s3"> that</span> it&#39;s quite<span style="s3"> that</span> far</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.849" end="00:39:01.059" style="s2">this is<span style="s4"> to</span> go out<span style="s3"> and visit some</span></p>

<p begin="00:39:03.700" end="00:39:07.599" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking of I think<span style="s4"> all</span> of the</p>

<p begin="00:39:14.130" end="00:39:18.400" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s going to be an</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.089" end="00:39:19.390" style="s2">actually really interesting question<span style="s4"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:39:18.400" end="00:39:21.579" style="s2">start probing with some of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.390" end="00:39:22.210" style="s2">organizations that were would be talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.579" end="00:39:26.410" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.210" end="00:39:29.670" style="s2">is if and how this isn&#39;t enhancing their</p>

<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:40.210" style="s2">at a lower cost and those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.930" end="00:39:42.670" style="s2">things<span style="s3"> but</span> actually influencing funders</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.210" end="00:39:46.020" style="s2">I think is that last piece that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.670" end="00:39:46.020" style="s2">know that<span style="s3"> we</span> meet you sue that yet</p>
