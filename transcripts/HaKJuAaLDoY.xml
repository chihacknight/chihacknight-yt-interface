<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:04.010" style="s2"><span style="s3">just</span> the messiness of</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.430" end="00:11:06.529" style="s2">one of the biggest challenges is when</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.010" end="00:11:08.330" style="s2">you have not just one set of data but</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.529" end="00:11:09.950" style="s2">multiple sets of data may be different</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.330" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">systems and you want to be<span style="s3"> able</span> to find</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.950" end="00:11:13.850" style="s2"><span style="s3">out</span> what are the things were the</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.850" end="00:11:17.210" style="s2">those<span style="s3"> ten</span> data sets I need to know that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.130" end="00:11:18.620" style="s2">before you can<span style="s4"> do</span> the really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.210" end="00:11:21.529" style="s2">stuff<span style="s4"> get</span><span style="s3"> to</span> do this really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.620" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">tedious work of linking to get their</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.529" end="00:11:26.120" style="s2">stuff and so we built this tool first as</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:29.830" style="s2">an open source library which you can go</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.120" end="00:11:32.950" style="s2">to over<span style="s3"> eight hundred</span><span style="s4"> stars</span> on github or</p>

<p begin="00:11:32.950" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">program works you can use this service</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.620" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">that we built so we&#39;re launching it as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:43.430" style="s2">product if you need to do<span style="s4"> this kind of</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:44.870" style="s2">linking of data meters<span style="s3"> I</span> build a wizard</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.430" end="00:11:46.459" style="s2">so you can step it through every step</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.870" end="00:11:48.920" style="s2">the process and get that<span style="s4"> I&#39;ve</span> linked up</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.459" end="00:11:52.459" style="s2">data at<span style="s3"> the</span> very so we launched it last</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.920" end="00:11:54.110" style="s2">week it was in<span style="s4"> private</span> beta ah if</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.010" end="00:12:22.910" style="s2">as opposed to sort of building a project</p>

<p begin="00:35:08.990" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">next step maybe the reading started here</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:16.280" style="s2">and those of the night room is almost</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">the same it&#39;s<span style="s4"> just</span> very hard because we</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.250" end="00:35:28.760" style="s2">almost the same thing we will<span style="s4"> get</span> to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.560" end="00:35:33.050" style="s2"><span style="s3">something</span> a little more intuitive in a</p>

<p begin="00:36:06.140" end="00:36:09.980" style="s2">into my brain and I will say that from</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.329" end="00:36:12.230" style="s2"><span style="s4">just like an engineering standpoint you</span></p>
<p begin="00:36:09.980" end="00:36:14.030" style="s2">can know that<span style="s3"> if</span> you&#39;re like driving</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.400" end="00:36:32.060" style="s2">line um you can talk<span style="s3"> more about this</span></p>
<p begin="00:36:28.849" end="00:36:33.410" style="s2">later but imagine each of these are two</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.870" end="00:37:40.280" style="s2">which will be clearer Emily so what we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.330" end="00:37:42.650" style="s2">did is we have these noisy rides where</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.280" end="00:37:44.810" style="s2">GPS has some bumps to it as a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.650" end="00:37:46.370" style="s2">of noise and people are kind of swerving</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.810" end="00:37:48.590" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re going about sidewalk stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.370" end="00:37:52.190" style="s2">like that so we need turn it off with</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.590" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">this blue line right here um and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.190" end="00:37:56.330" style="s2">you can see it&#39;s<span style="s4"> kind</span> of we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:58.190" style="s2">is we want to line it up<span style="s3"> to</span> underline</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.260" end="00:40:58.350" style="s2">probably what&#39;s parachute we&#39;ve ever</p>

<p begin="00:41:01.260" end="00:41:04.170" style="s2">one of the things we talked about in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.670" end="00:41:06.780" style="s2">group now that we have to measure how</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.170" end="00:41:08.520" style="s2">bumpy roads are how do<span style="s4"> we</span> get amazing</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.780" end="00:41:10.340" style="s2">how much people like being on the roads</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.520" end="00:41:11.980" style="s2">and it turned out the answer is<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:41:10.340" end="00:41:14.530" style="s2">right before</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.980" end="00:41:17.800" style="s2">it&#39;s doing<span style="s4"> something very similar</span> if</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.530" end="00:41:19.150" style="s2">that people get this map here and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.800" end="00:41:21.460" style="s2"><span style="s4">I&#39;ll</span> pull it<span style="s4"> up</span><span style="s3"> and</span><span style="s4"> show</span> you a big one</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.150" end="00:41:23.950" style="s2">looks almost exactly like what we did</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.460" end="00:41:25.570" style="s2">except<span style="s3"> for</span> instead<span style="s4"> of</span> what we<span style="s4"> did</span> is we</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.950" end="00:41:26.800" style="s2">tell you how bumpy is a road in a given</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.570" end="00:41:29.020" style="s2">area they&#39;re going to tell them how much</p>

<p begin="00:43:55.210" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">all state and you say probably the best</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.220" end="00:44:00.640" style="s2">way to do<span style="s3"> this</span> is to<span style="s4"> figure</span> out<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.590" style="s2">direction of gravity and then<span style="s4"> only</span> use</p>

<p begin="00:44:02.590" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">slightly tipping all the time so right</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.450" end="00:44:07.450" style="s2">now I just use the overall course</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:20.910" style="s2">regardless<span style="s4"> of</span> reaction that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.450" end="00:44:35.530" style="s2"><span style="s4">not</span> right seems like actually working</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.910" end="00:44:41.830" style="s2">people are swimming yeah just behavior</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.530" end="00:44:43.330" style="s2">people yeah and dessert yeah and of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.830" end="00:44:45.070" style="s2">course it also you have to<span style="s4"> get</span> great</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.330" end="00:44:46.780" style="s2">about since<span style="s4"> you</span> can probably determine a</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.070" end="00:44:49.000" style="s2">lot you can probably<span style="s3"> figure</span> out how</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.780" end="00:44:51.040" style="s2"><span style="s4">who&#39;s</span> somebody<span style="s4"> is</span> earlier accelerometer</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.000" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">data so you<span style="s4"> probably</span> be<span style="s4"> careful</span> you were</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.040" end="00:44:54.160" style="s2">going to expand this out if you<span style="s3"> might</span> be</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.160" end="00:45:01.060" style="s2">played it off but it&#39;s awesome right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.860" end="00:45:03.360" style="s2">between the<span style="s4"> disc</span> medical needs you can</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.420" end="00:45:11.900" style="s2">and is there<span style="s4"> any</span> way to like give advice</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.940" end="00:45:24.290" style="s2">but somehow we&#39;ve used right<span style="s4"> imately</span></p>
<p begin="00:45:11.900" end="00:45:26.420" style="s2">actually gonna go to<span style="s4"> tell</span> her oh they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.290" end="00:45:29.450" style="s2">be great yeah they<span style="s4"> are technology in</span></p>
<p begin="00:45:26.420" end="00:45:31.220" style="s2">them to measure this um<span style="s4"> I</span> haven&#39;t<span style="s4"> any</span></p>

<p begin="00:45:31.220" end="00:45:34.970" style="s2">but that&#39;s somebody we definitely will</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.810" end="00:45:36.860" style="s2">try if anybody<span style="s4"> knows</span> to be<span style="s3"> people</span> that</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.970" end="00:45:39.740" style="s2">would<span style="s3"> be</span> lovely really<span style="s3"> because</span> that</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.180" end="00:45:44.360" style="s2">and has the infrastructure in place so</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.130" end="00:45:46.660" style="s2">it&#39;s possible victim you know well</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.360" end="00:45:53.870" style="s2">something out<span style="s3"> and</span> grab<span style="s3"> your</span> data files</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.660" end="00:45:56.540" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s the symptom frequencies were</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.870" end="00:45:58.430" style="s2"><span style="s4">longer only for the iphone it was a</span></p>

<p begin="00:45:58.430" end="00:46:04.070" style="s2">phone it probably depends on your model</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.080" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">but 100 Earth&#39;s is probably more than</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.070" end="00:46:10.870" style="s2">enough to do what we need to do two</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:13.130" style="s2">sauces yeah I didn&#39;t do that but<span style="s4"> then</span></p>
<p begin="00:46:10.870" end="00:46:15.830" style="s2">after I figured that out<span style="s3"> it</span> was unclear</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.130" end="00:46:17.390" style="s2"><span style="s3">to</span><span style="s4"> me</span> like what part of the spectrum we</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.830" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">really cared about like what part is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.390" end="00:46:20.690" style="s2">bumpiness and it seemed like well all of</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.360" style="s2"><span style="s3">it</span> is probably bad as you&#39;re going up</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.690" end="00:46:25.040" style="s2">and down so that&#39;s why you look at</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.360" end="00:46:27.050" style="s2">overall measure but yeah if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.040" end="00:46:31.130" style="s2">interested<span style="s3"> it</span><span style="s4"> I</span> can show<span style="s4"> you</span> that there</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.050" end="00:46:33.620" style="s2">are some plots yeah<span style="s4"> i&#39;ve used something</span></p>
