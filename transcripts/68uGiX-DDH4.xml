<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:26.430" style="s2">working the other way so the question</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.820" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> came to my mind<span style="s3"> was</span> what can be</p>

<p begin="00:02:33.000" end="00:02:41.100" style="s2">somewhat so our voice ultimately is kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">of the response to that that moment so</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.100" end="00:02:45.810" style="s2">in my research so I knew there was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:47.550" style="s2">problem I didn&#39;t<span style="s3"> know</span> the extent of<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:45.810" end="00:02:50.700" style="s2">problem and here&#39;s an example of one<span style="s4"> of</span></p>

<p begin="00:02:50.700" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">let me define wage theft because in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.920" end="00:02:56.459" style="s2">previous talk somebody<span style="s4"> came</span> back and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.080" end="00:03:01.410" style="s2">said I<span style="s4"> don&#39;t</span><span style="s3"> know</span> what wage theft is</p>

<p begin="00:03:02.820" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">all those hours that&#39;s wage theft if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.890" end="00:03:09.600" style="s2">work overtime and don&#39;t get paid the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:12.690" style="s2">correct overtime rate that&#39;s wage theft</p>

<p begin="00:03:17.550" end="00:03:22.650" style="s2">while you&#39;re working that&#39;s wage stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.100" end="00:03:25.970" style="s2">so there<span style="s4"> are</span> all kinds of<span style="s3"> varieties</span> of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.650" end="00:03:29.480" style="s2">wage theft the most recent example being</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:45.300" style="s2">does the same thing because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.019" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">huge amount of money so it&#39;s estimated</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.300" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">that wage theft is about a<span style="s3"> 50</span> billion</p>

<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> that&#39;s a huge amount of money if</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.880" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">and thinking from an economist</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:04:00.870" style="s2">standpoint if you could reintroduce that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:03.450" style="s2">money to those workers give them money</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.870" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">that they actually<span style="s3"> earned</span> that would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.450" end="00:04:08.610" style="s2">a 50 billion dollar stimulus to the</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.610" end="00:04:14.130" style="s2">so<span style="s4"> that</span> that&#39;s<span style="s3"> kind</span> of the<span style="s3"> thinking</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:11.700" end="00:04:16.729" style="s2">behind that this chart relates to a UIC</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.130" end="00:04:19.109" style="s2">study that was done several years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.729" end="00:04:22.530" style="s2">where they looked at very low wage</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.109" end="00:04:24.510" style="s2"><span style="s3">hourly</span> workers they brought them in had</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.000" end="00:04:32.520" style="s2">if they were paid properly and as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">can<span style="s4"> see</span> from the chart this is for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">prior week sixty-seven percent of those</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.170" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">my mind so I knew there were there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.990" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">an issue and the the idea or the the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:05:00.750" style="s2">theme of the response to that is in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">voices terms transparency and so this<span style="s3"> is</span></p>
<p begin="00:05:00.750" end="00:05:05.880" style="s2"><span style="s4">a</span> bit different transparency than what</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">we usually talk about<span style="s3"> here</span> at hack night</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.880" end="00:05:10.169" style="s2">that&#39;s you we&#39;re usually talking about</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.900" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2"><span style="s3">something</span> positive with this with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.150" end="00:05:21.990" style="s2">this is a little<span style="s3"> bit</span> different and in</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.090" end="00:05:34.410" style="s2">from the workplace through the workers</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.730" end="00:05:37.410" style="s2">and potentially providing that data to</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.410" end="00:05:40.470" style="s2">and I&#39;ll get into a little<span style="s3"> bit</span> more</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.640" end="00:05:42.450" style="s2">detail why I<span style="s4"> think</span><span style="s3"> that</span> would<span style="s4"> be</span></p>
<p begin="00:05:40.470" end="00:05:46.620" style="s2">effective but that data could also be</p>

<p begin="00:05:46.620" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">unions and for plaintiff attorneys who</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:54.900" style="s2">are filing wage theft lawsuits which are</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:57.150" style="s2">becoming much more prevalent for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.900" end="00:06:00.150" style="s2">variety of reasons so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.150" end="00:06:02.610" style="s2">workers<span style="s3"> can</span> report on working conditions</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.150" end="00:06:05.790" style="s2">on kind of a systematic basis so this is</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.340" end="00:06:13.590" style="s2">like that the idea is you rate your</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.240" end="00:07:26.460" style="s2">employers as well this<span style="s3"> is</span> a bit</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.790" end="00:07:29.400" style="s2"><span style="s3">different</span> than glass door so one of<span style="s3"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:26.460" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">early things I looked at was glass door</p>

<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:36.600" style="s2">employees so would ask questions like do</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.840" end="00:07:53.700" style="s2">do you get that kind<span style="s3"> of</span> thing so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.330" end="00:07:56.520" style="s2"><span style="s3">idea</span> is we can collect a lot<span style="s3"> of</span> data we</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.070" end="00:18:47.730" style="s2">so we really looked at what are<span style="s3"> the</span> key</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:34.200" style="s2">in doing that and yeah we see a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.100" end="00:19:35.880" style="s2">you know heat maps every other chart</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.200" end="00:19:37.410" style="s2">that<span style="s3"> you</span> can put up there it&#39;s<span style="s3"> not</span></p>

<p begin="00:19:44.610" end="00:19:48.000" style="s2">and it really goes into when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.380" end="00:19:49.860" style="s2">tues analytics when trying to<span style="s3"> get</span> people</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.000" end="00:19:51.420" style="s2"><span style="s3">look</span> at it<span style="s3"> so</span> the dashboard that was up</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.860" end="00:19:53.700" style="s2">there that right now that&#39;s<span style="s3"> just</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.420" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">mock-up what we&#39;re now trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.700" end="00:19:58.290" style="s2">arrange meetings with these various</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:00.420" style="s2">worker advocate groups to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.290" end="00:20:01.430" style="s2">validate the design get more</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.420" end="00:20:04.180" style="s2">requirements</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.430" end="00:20:06.920" style="s2"><span style="s3">and</span> so<span style="s3"> that</span><span style="s4"> you</span> can actually build it</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.180" end="00:20:13.160" style="s2">it&#39;s all data we have to know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.920" end="00:20:15.670" style="s2">nothing<span style="s4"> up there that&#39;s mocked so their</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:13.160" end="00:20:19.220" style="s2">variety of ways to<span style="s3"> do</span> that so heat maps</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.670" end="00:20:21.290" style="s2">one of my favorite we fight against it</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.220" end="00:20:25.970" style="s2">sometimes our internal discussions are</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.290" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">always lively yeah yeah<span style="s3"> Ryan</span> is not one</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.970" end="00:20:29.420" style="s2">of those i&#39;ll just do whatever you tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:33.980" style="s2">me to do you&#39;re<span style="s4"> going</span><span style="s3"> to</span> guys which I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.420" end="00:20:36.770" style="s2">which I appreciate most of the time the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.980" end="00:20:39.710" style="s2">the challenges going forward long-term</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.770" end="00:20:41.720" style="s2">challenges are obviously the adoption</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.710" end="00:20:44.840" style="s2">this is kind of we have<span style="s3"> to</span> achieve some</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:47.480" style="s2"><span style="s4">Network</span> effects of users providing</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.330" end="00:20:53.300" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to<span style="s3"> get</span> those<span style="s4"> Network</span></p>

<p begin="00:20:53.300" end="00:20:59.420" style="s2"><span style="s3">challenging</span> and then we have to<span style="s3"> make</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:57.320" end="00:21:02.300" style="s2">sure that data is credible so I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.420" end="00:21:04.580" style="s2"><span style="s3">there&#39;s</span> some analytics or machine</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.300" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">learning can kind of help there to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.580" end="00:21:08.980" style="s2">sure<span style="s3"> that</span> the ratings are credible</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:12.470" style="s2">there&#39;s always controversy over with</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.980" end="00:21:15.260" style="s2">Yelp in terms of can you trust all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.470" end="00:21:18.410" style="s2">ratings<span style="s3"> I</span> think<span style="s4"> what</span> we&#39;re<span style="s4"> doing</span> makes</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.260" end="00:21:20.390" style="s2">makes this process easier and more</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.410" end="00:21:27.620" style="s2">amenable to some analytics that make</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.390" end="00:21:28.760" style="s2">sure that the data is credible but we</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.620" end="00:21:31.400" style="s2">haven&#39;t really<span style="s3"> figured</span> out what that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.760" end="00:21:33.230" style="s2">approach is we&#39;re<span style="s3"> actually</span> user testing</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.400" end="00:21:35.900" style="s2">you right now how you react<span style="s4"> to different</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:33.230" end="00:21:37.700" style="s2">light schemes yeah and<span style="s4"> presentation</span> so</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.900" end="00:21:40.640" style="s2">thank you anybody study the Hawthorne</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.700" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">effect in in business school anyway</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.640" end="00:21:47.300" style="s2">sorry very old time Joe yeah and one</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">thing with with<span style="s3"> the</span> challenge is coming</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.300" end="00:21:52.670" style="s2">up it really is how do you get that data</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">but how do<span style="s3"> you</span> in like incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.670" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">people to do it because<span style="s3"> the</span> insights is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:59.060" style="s2">important but no one&#39;s going to log on</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:01.250" style="s2"><span style="s4">to</span> a nap and just read you know it seems</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.060" end="00:22:02.840" style="s2"><span style="s3">like</span><span style="s4"> you</span> should this is important stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.250" end="00:22:04.550" style="s2">so we&#39;re trying<span style="s3"> to</span> do that<span style="s3"> by</span> asking</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.840" end="00:22:05.930" style="s2">questions<span style="s3"> and</span> learn from<span style="s3"> them</span> and really</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.550" end="00:22:08.810" style="s2">present in little nuggets of information</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.930" end="00:22:10.730" style="s2">to help them and set the path of I want</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.810" end="00:22:13.010" style="s2">to know more about this wage theft is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.730" end="00:22:14.570" style="s2"><span style="s3">the</span> primary example for it but no one&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:26.630" style="s2">lead them down that trail to learn more</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.630" end="00:22:32.180" style="s2">like that so<span style="s3"> literally</span> a heat map where</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.999" end="00:26:13.100" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely<span style="s4"> a</span> hypothesis I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.340" end="00:26:15.289" style="s2">we try to clarify that<span style="s3"> you</span> know your</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.879" end="00:26:20.870" style="s2">compelling so we&#39;ve got to figure<span style="s3"> out</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.159" end="00:26:22.370" style="s2">way to do that<span style="s3"> I</span> mean part of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.870" end="00:26:25.549" style="s2">problem is we&#39;re just<span style="s4"> not</span> known so</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.370" end="00:26:27.980" style="s2">there&#39;s no our voice isn&#39;t a known brand</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.549" end="00:26:30.679" style="s2">of something<span style="s4"> that</span> you can trust so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.980" end="00:26:33.499" style="s2">people<span style="s3"> are</span> at least think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.679" end="00:26:35.779" style="s2">they&#39;re taking a risk so it&#39;s a concern</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.499" end="00:26:37.429" style="s2">and there is an opening part once people</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.779" end="00:26:39.080" style="s2">joined in that we have they have to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.429" end="00:26:41.059" style="s2">through<span style="s4"> a</span> three-step process which kind</p>

<p begin="00:26:47.240" end="00:26:52.850" style="s2"><span style="s3">incredible</span> ratio I mean the reaction we</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.629" end="00:26:55.429" style="s2">get when I mean I literally go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.850" end="00:26:57.409" style="s2">restaurants and I hit<span style="s4"> up</span> on<span style="s3"> the servers</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:55.429" end="00:27:00.529" style="s2">and hey try this and I described and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.409" end="00:27:03.230" style="s2">they say it&#39;s fantastic and then not all</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.529" end="00:27:05.149" style="s2"><span style="s4">of</span><span style="s3"> them</span> sign up so we haven&#39;t<span style="s3"> quite</span></p>

<p begin="00:27:13.430" end="00:27:18.180" style="s2">so well there<span style="s3"> are</span> a couple things we</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.260" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">don&#39;t I think<span style="s4"> do</span> this quite yet in terms</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.180" end="00:27:24.390" style="s2">of validating their location so that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:29.340" style="s2">can kind<span style="s3"> of</span> fight kind<span style="s3"> of</span> sock puppetry</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.390" end="00:27:32.700" style="s2">or astroturfing statistic we were asking</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.340" end="00:27:35.460" style="s2">basically mostly Numerical questions how</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.460" end="00:27:39.330" style="s2">advance is your schedule we do ask some</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.890" end="00:27:42.270" style="s2">kind of like Erick scale stuff for the</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.270" end="00:27:47.100" style="s2">we<span style="s3"> don&#39;t allow comments right now one</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:44.700" end="00:27:49.830" style="s2">reason is for that the other<span style="s3"> reason</span> is</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.100" end="00:27:52.860" style="s2">to prevent workers from outing</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.830" end="00:27:55.530" style="s2">themselves so the scenario could be</p>
