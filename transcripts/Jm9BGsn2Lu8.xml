<p begin="00:14:42.090" end="00:14:48.090" style="s2"><span style="s3">from</span> and we want to carry into what we</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.300" end="00:14:50.130" style="s2">do and so we had to figure<span style="s3"> out</span> you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:15:09.180" end="00:15:14.310" style="s2">ordinance but I think its resolution for</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.330" end="00:15:18.540" style="s2">utilizing open source where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.310" end="00:15:22.950" style="s2">and and we did use<span style="s3"> Drupal</span> 7 for this we</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.289" end="00:24:27.820" style="s2">evolution will continue we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.480" end="00:24:30.340" style="s2">this as done we<span style="s3"> have</span> a lot of<span style="s3"> planned</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:27.820" end="00:24:32.919" style="s2">future development we there&#39;s a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.340" end="00:24:34.989" style="s2">button we look at that feedback we</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.919" end="00:24:37.059" style="s2">relish that feedback good bad or</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.989" end="00:24:38.710" style="s2">indifferent completeness would help not</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.059" end="00:24:43.330" style="s2">just saying this sucks it doesn&#39;t<span style="s3"> help</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:38.710" end="00:24:45.489" style="s2">me so any analytics you<span style="s3"> know</span> we come</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.320" end="00:24:51.369" style="s2">we want to learn and fix<span style="s3"> it</span> and make it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.450" end="00:24:52.539" style="s2">better early on we found a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.369" end="00:24:54.879" style="s2">things we&#39;re like why is<span style="s3"> this</span> happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.539" end="00:24:56.230" style="s2">oh<span style="s4"> geez</span> and<span style="s3"> we</span> quickly you&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.879" end="00:24:58.299" style="s2">some of the things just to try<span style="s4"> and</span> get</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.230" end="00:24:59.529" style="s2">them to<span style="s3"> where</span> we need them to go so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.299" end="00:25:01.179" style="s2">are<span style="s4"> very</span> interested in trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.529" end="00:25:02.980" style="s2"><span style="s3">this</span> better for the users public user</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.179" end="00:25:04.929" style="s2">testing is something we&#39;re<span style="s4"> going</span><span style="s3"> to</span> is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.980" end="00:25:06.609" style="s2">also part of our planned continued</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.929" end="00:25:08.859" style="s2">development we want to<span style="s3"> make</span> sure things</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.609" end="00:25:12.070" style="s2">we do are actually things that are going</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.859" end="00:25:14.169" style="s2"><span style="s3">to</span> work governance we are establishing a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.070" end="00:25:15.999" style="s2"><span style="s4">good</span> governance group here to make<span style="s4"> sure</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:14.169" end="00:25:18.759" style="s2">that the way we&#39;re<span style="s3"> doing</span> things is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.999" end="00:25:20.590" style="s2">planned and isn&#39;t just rational because</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.759" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">somebody likes it that we vet it as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.590" end="00:25:24.700" style="s2">group before<span style="s4"> we</span> decide to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:26.679" style="s2">with it we&#39;re<span style="s3"> going to be adding things</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:24.700" end="00:25:27.970" style="s2">like social media expansion so that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.679" end="00:25:29.320" style="s2">have a lot more channels to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.970" end="00:25:30.759" style="s2">information<span style="s4"> out</span> to you and integrate it</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.320" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2"><span style="s4">and</span> get them back<span style="s3"> into</span> the information</p>

<p begin="00:25:56.289" end="00:26:02.279" style="s2"><span style="s3">excited</span><span style="s4"> to</span> have this finally out there</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.909" end="00:26:02.279" style="s2">to<span style="s4"> you</span> and to see<span style="s3"> what</span> you<span style="s4"> have</span> to say</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:42.140" style="s2">sure go forth well part of it is look</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.040" end="00:26:43.760" style="s2">having governance you know and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.140" end="00:26:45.890" style="s2">part of what we&#39;re<span style="s3"> trying</span> to do having a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.760" end="00:26:48.740" style="s2">standard having a standard way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.890" end="00:26:50.990" style="s2">something is done or presented or the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.740" end="00:26:53.570" style="s2">tools that<span style="s4"> you</span> use to do X or Y or Z and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.990" end="00:26:56.360" style="s2">trust me we had a lot of agencies in</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.570" end="00:26:58.430" style="s2">here and they have had nothing<span style="s4"> but</span> fun</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.360" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">things to suggest and about how we did</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.430" end="00:27:04.910" style="s2">this wrong<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span> and so part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:07.190" style="s2">through sort of having<span style="s4"> that</span> governance</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.910" end="00:27:09.350" style="s2">as your backbone to fall against and say</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.190" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">really<span style="s3"> oh</span> so you think agencies should</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.350" end="00:27:15.650" style="s2">now be called offices<span style="s3"> okay</span> well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:18.860" style="s2">put this to the test then and that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.650" end="00:27:21.380" style="s2">we can say okay look this is what we had</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.860" end="00:27:22.700" style="s2">decided and vetted but if<span style="s3"> we</span><span style="s4"> really</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:21.380" end="00:27:24.350" style="s2">think<span style="s3"> that</span> it&#39;s necessary for some</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.700" end="00:27:26.780" style="s2">reason and<span style="s3"> there&#39;s</span> a lot<span style="s4"> of</span> push great</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.350" end="00:27:28.760" style="s2">let&#39;s put it<span style="s3"> in</span> front<span style="s3"> of</span> public user</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.780" end="00:27:31.220" style="s2">testing let&#39;s have some a be testing</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.760" end="00:27:32.720" style="s2">done and see which resonates more with</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.220" end="00:27:35.480" style="s2">people do people think that the word</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.720" end="00:27:38.180" style="s2">offices means locations more than<span style="s3"> they</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:35.480" end="00:27:40.760" style="s2">do think that<span style="s3"> it means agencies or are</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:38.180" end="00:27:43.280" style="s2">they right maybe offices is more part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.760" end="00:27:46.490" style="s2">the public vernacular than agencies is</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.280" end="00:27:48.650" style="s2">so it&#39;s more<span style="s3"> saying</span> this is what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.490" end="00:27:50.420" style="s2">decided and here&#39;s the process for if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.650" end="00:27:51.980" style="s2">need<span style="s4"> to</span> if if there&#39;s a decision<span style="s4"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:50.420" end="00:27:53.690" style="s2">maybe we should change it let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.980" end="00:27:55.430" style="s2"><span style="s3">sure</span> it&#39;s not<span style="s3"> a</span> change just<span style="s4"> for</span> because</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.690" end="00:27:57.410" style="s2">somebody said so but that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.430" end="00:27:58.670" style="s2">vet why come up with<span style="s3"> the</span> decision</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.410" end="00:28:03.100" style="s2">together and make sure<span style="s3"> that</span><span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.670" end="00:28:03.100" style="s2">right decision to use yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.740" end="00:28:16.190" style="s2">lots we we part of our contract<span style="s3"> was</span> for</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.420" end="00:28:18.980" style="s2">build and maintenance for ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.190" end="00:28:21.020" style="s2">develop more so we admittedly are not</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.980" end="00:28:23.450" style="s2">the dribble experts but we are trying<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:21.020" end="00:28:25.310" style="s2">ramp up our internal<span style="s3"> Drupal</span> skills so</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.450" end="00:28:28.880" style="s2">that we can do more heavy lifting</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.310" end="00:28:31.670" style="s2">ourselves on the we can&#39;t always be as</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.880" end="00:28:33.350" style="s2">nimble as we<span style="s3"> might</span> like from a skills in</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.670" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">a hiring perspective and our staffing</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.350" end="00:28:38.900" style="s2">perspective budgets things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:40.970" style="s2">so sometimes outsourcing is how we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.900" end="00:28:44.900" style="s2">ramp up to that and but we are working</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.970" end="00:28:47.090" style="s2"><span style="s3">on</span> now maturing our internal skills so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.900" end="00:28:48.950" style="s2">that we can do more on our own and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.090" end="00:28:49.970" style="s2">continue more<span style="s4"> on</span> this way but we made</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.950" end="00:28:51.920" style="s2"><span style="s4">sure</span> that we&#39;ve got the belt and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.970" end="00:28:54.440" style="s2"><span style="s3">suspenders</span> of support for for</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.920" end="00:28:56.230" style="s2">development for a while and we needed</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.440" end="00:28:59.870" style="s2"><span style="s3">that we needed</span> also the sorry the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.230" end="00:29:01.340" style="s2">expertise the maturity if we go out<span style="s4"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:59.870" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">start learning<span style="s4"> it</span> we&#39;re not<span style="s3"> going</span> to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.340" end="00:29:05.210" style="s2">very<span style="s3"> good</span> at what<span style="s3"> we</span> do and not have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:07.220" style="s2"><span style="s3">very</span><span style="s4"> good</span> approach to it so we really</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.210" end="00:29:11.350" style="s2">need some expertise to help us get there</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.220" end="00:29:11.350" style="s2">as we ramp up yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.190" end="00:29:26.630" style="s2">with in Cook County oh yeah you<span style="s4"> know</span> I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.300" end="00:29:29.480" style="s2"><span style="s4">can&#39;t</span> okay<span style="s4"> so</span> what I can say is that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.630" end="00:29:32.000" style="s2">actually<span style="s3"> so</span> when we did this we did it</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.480" end="00:29:35.180" style="s2">with the mindset that we<span style="s3"> were</span> building a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:38.840" style="s2">core we wanted to build a course site</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.180" end="00:29:41.090" style="s2">model that then could be leveraged if</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.840" end="00:29:43.970" style="s2">other agencies other elected offices</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.090" end="00:29:45.920" style="s2">wished to leverage this they could and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.970" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2"><span style="s4">actually</span> the recorder not the record of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.920" end="00:29:49.700" style="s2"><span style="s3">Deeds</span> but the border review was actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:51.320" style="s2">in written in the contract as our first</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.700" end="00:29:53.870" style="s2">user that&#39;s<span style="s3"> actually</span> part of scope and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.320" end="00:29:55.310" style="s2">so they are going<span style="s3"> to</span> now be they just</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.870" end="00:29:57.050" style="s2">finished a really big project on there</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.310" end="00:29:59.660" style="s2">and<span style="s3"> they&#39;re</span> now going to be working<span style="s4"> with</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:57.050" end="00:30:02.180" style="s2">our vendor to take this core and</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.660" end="00:30:06.350" style="s2">basically apply it to their web content</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.180" end="00:30:08.720" style="s2">and move from there and<span style="s3"> i</span><span style="s4"> believe</span> i</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.350" end="00:30:11.950" style="s2">think the clerk is also going to click</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.320" end="00:30:22.280" style="s2">think public defender so we we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.610" end="00:30:24.890" style="s2">basically tried to be efficient and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.280" end="00:30:27.410" style="s2">share at least starting internally to</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.890" end="00:30:29.210" style="s2">leverage the same things that<span style="s3"> we&#39;ve</span></p>

<p begin="00:30:40.250" end="00:30:43.970" style="s2">as an option<span style="s4"> for</span> them we&#39;ve kind of done</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.930" end="00:30:46.190" style="s2">the dirty work in a sense some of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.970" end="00:30:48.560" style="s2">hard work in the back<span style="s4"> end</span> in what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.190" end="00:30:50.810" style="s2">the idea is then that we will continue</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.160" end="00:30:59.810" style="s2">develop and maintain so<span style="s3"> that</span> they can</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.570" end="00:31:02.630" style="s2">write off of that and also then as these</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.810" end="00:31:04.190" style="s2">groups start up we will bring<span style="s3"> them in</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:02.630" end="00:31:06.860" style="s2">when we&#39;re<span style="s4"> looking</span> at any kind of<span style="s3"> new</span></p>

<p begin="00:32:38.669" end="00:32:44.700" style="s2">you know<span style="s4"> what I really would say it</span></p>
<p begin="00:32:42.389" end="00:32:47.159" style="s2">totally depends because there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.700" end="00:32:48.870" style="s2">stuff where you there&#39;s some outliers</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.159" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">sites like if they would go to watch the</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.870" end="00:32:55.019" style="s2">board<span style="s4"> meeting</span> page there on for hours</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:56.669" style="s2">and that&#39;s long time you know<span style="s3"> so</span> that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.019" end="00:32:58.649" style="s2">a<span style="s4"> really</span> good question i&#39;m just trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.669" end="00:33:01.740" style="s2"><span style="s4">to</span> think<span style="s3"> of</span> some good averages to give</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.649" end="00:33:05.429" style="s2">you<span style="s4"> i</span> mean<span style="s4"> i</span> was typically saw visits</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.740" end="00:33:06.990" style="s2">like in the<span style="s4"> 32 34 minute range and</span></p>
<p begin="00:33:05.429" end="00:33:08.309" style="s2">there&#39;s also times where we open a</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.990" end="00:33:09.419" style="s2">window to something else and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.309" end="00:33:11.880" style="s2">they&#39;ll come<span style="s3"> back</span> so you know there were</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.419" end="00:33:13.950" style="s2">some things that didn&#39;t fit a normal</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.880" end="00:33:15.929" style="s2">model but those are things we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.950" end="00:33:19.620" style="s2"><span style="s3">looking</span><span style="s4"> at now on the path and then how</span></p>
<p begin="00:33:15.929" end="00:33:26.039" style="s2">quickly they&#39;re in out you know how got</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.620" end="00:33:27.210" style="s2">me too yeah<span style="s3"> which</span> the you notes that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.039" end="00:33:29.700" style="s2">actually one of the things we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.210" end="00:33:32.669" style="s2">looking<span style="s3"> at</span> in is how we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.700" end="00:33:34.019" style="s2">unexposed some of the analytics out to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.669" end="00:33:36.750" style="s2">the site and where that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.019" end="00:33:38.519" style="s2">useful versus just<span style="s3"> like</span> geek blue you</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.750" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">know they all right i mean else is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.519" end="00:33:43.950" style="s2">all afternoon on<span style="s3"> on</span> google analytics if</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:45.929" style="s2">you&#39;ll let me but we&#39;d like<span style="s4"> to</span> see what</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.950" end="00:33:47.610" style="s2">what&#39;s like relevant and useful and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.929" end="00:33:49.440" style="s2">make<span style="s4"> sure</span> we can get that out there and</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.610" end="00:33:52.919" style="s2">and maybe even contextualize it you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.440" end="00:33:56.730" style="s2">where certain things<span style="s4"> are</span> in context<span style="s3"> okay</span></p>
<p begin="00:33:52.919" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">who is it oh I&#39;m sorry she was<span style="s3"> like</span></p>
<p begin="00:33:56.730" end="00:34:00.080" style="s2">waiting earlier I<span style="s4"> got</span> it</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.429" end="00:34:14.629" style="s2">yeah I mean<span style="s4"> I</span> i think it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.440" end="00:34:16.580" style="s2">like modeling and explaining and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.629" end="00:34:17.929" style="s2">part of why you know we&#39;ve will</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.580" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">sometimes sit with them when we were</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.929" end="00:34:24.110" style="s2">going through things like you<span style="s3"> know</span> what</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:25.940" style="s2">if<span style="s4"> we</span> put more on the page<span style="s3"> and</span> it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.110" end="00:34:27.879" style="s2">too<span style="s3"> but</span> let&#39;s like bring this all and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.940" end="00:34:30.080" style="s2">put it<span style="s4"> here</span> so they see it right away</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.879" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">you know so<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> just<span style="s3"> sort</span> of pointing</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.080" end="00:34:34.970" style="s2">it out sometimes they&#39;re so used to just</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:37.610" style="s2">here&#39;s<span style="s3"> my</span> PDF and I put it here<span style="s3"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:34:34.970" end="00:34:39.230" style="s2">people link and open it they don&#39;t<span style="s3"> think</span></p>
<p begin="00:34:37.610" end="00:34:41.179" style="s2"><span style="s4">about it it&#39;s hard when they get out</span><span style="s3"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:34:39.230" end="00:34:43.159" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> rut so that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.179" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">why<span style="s4"> I</span> said that we were<span style="s3"> actually</span> looking</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.159" end="00:34:48.860" style="s2">to to do sort<span style="s4"> of</span> consulting gigs with</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:50.510" style="s2">each of them regularly so we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.860" end="00:34:53.120" style="s2">look through those things look for areas</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.510" end="00:34:57.530" style="s2">where we can say what about<span style="s3"> this and how</span></p>
<p begin="00:34:53.120" end="00:34:59.060" style="s2">can you yeah I<span style="s3"> mean</span> it in terms of just</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.530" end="00:35:00.950" style="s2">getting the content stripped out and</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.060" end="00:35:02.330" style="s2">then just adding it straight content to</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.950" end="00:35:03.860" style="s2">the page kind of working<span style="s3"> through</span> it with</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.330" end="00:35:05.750" style="s2">them and showing them how they could do</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.860" end="00:35:07.010" style="s2"><span style="s4">it a little differently and I really</span></p>
<p begin="00:35:05.750" end="00:35:09.710" style="s2">think sometimes that just individual</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.010" end="00:35:10.700" style="s2">hand-holding with groups you<span style="s4"> know</span> we did</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.710" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">it<span style="s4"> with</span> some where<span style="s3"> they</span> were having</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.700" end="00:35:15.260" style="s2">particular issues and we&#39;d sit like what</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:17.420" style="s2">if we did<span style="s3"> and</span> we put<span style="s4"> them</span> as these<span style="s3"> types</span></p>
<p begin="00:35:15.260" end="00:35:18.710" style="s2">of things oh that&#39;s everything and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.420" end="00:35:21.140" style="s2"><span style="s4">know</span> all of a sudden it breaks the<span style="s4"> dam</span></p>
<p begin="00:35:18.710" end="00:35:23.240" style="s2"><span style="s4">and</span> they&#39;re fine so I think<span style="s3"> sometimes</span> it</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.140" end="00:35:25.550" style="s2">is that<span style="s3"> kind</span> of hand-holding change</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.240" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">management is<span style="s3"> really</span> challenging issue</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.550" end="00:35:29.330" style="s2">with with<span style="s3"> the</span> project roll out here and</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:31.880" style="s2">it&#39;s going<span style="s3"> to be an evolving thing as</span></p>
<p begin="00:35:29.330" end="00:35:33.860" style="s2">well so I think hand-holding and demoing</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.880" end="00:35:35.780" style="s2">and showing them why it&#39;s<span style="s3"> different</span> and</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.860" end="00:35:38.510" style="s2">better this way and they can edit it way</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.780" end="00:35:40.850" style="s2">easier to but anyway<span style="s3"> okay</span> and<span style="s4"> I think</span></p>
<p begin="00:35:38.510" end="00:35:43.640" style="s2">that was it yeah and we will be around</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.850" end="00:35:45.830" style="s2">for<span style="s4"> a</span> while<span style="s3"> afterwards</span> so as our own</p>
