<p begin="00:02:34.379" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">instead the<span style="s3"> oftentimes</span> folks are</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.209" end="00:02:53.670" style="s2">right<span style="s3"> now our work is particularly</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:51.359" end="00:02:57.959" style="s2">focused on the folks who work in local</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.670" end="00:03:03.209" style="s2"><span style="s3">elections</span><span style="s4"> um</span> and also helping<span style="s4"> to</span> provide</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.959" end="00:03:04.709" style="s2">data around elections so uh we do three</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.209" end="00:03:06.780" style="s2">main things to get towards our mission</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.709" end="00:03:08.549" style="s2">the first one is helping<span style="s4"> folks</span> who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">responsible for<span style="s3"> writing</span> local elections</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.549" end="00:03:13.260" style="s2">so county election administrators they</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:15.299" style="s2">might be auditors or reporters they take</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.260" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">lots<span style="s4"> of</span> different hats clerks here in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.299" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2"><span style="s4">Chicago</span> and we help to network them to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.930" end="00:03:23.790" style="s2">share best practices and we also deliver</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:26.940" style="s2">trainings specifically on building</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.790" end="00:03:28.590" style="s2">skills around<span style="s4"> technology</span> last year was</p>

<p begin="00:03:28.590" end="00:03:32.280" style="s2">trainings and we trained around 300</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.280" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">with the<span style="s4"> particular</span> focus right now on</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:39.930" style="s2">helping officials learn how<span style="s4"> to</span> publish</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">and maintain their own website and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.930" end="00:03:43.470" style="s2">might seem<span style="s3"> like</span> something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:45.209" style="s2">relatively simple but one data point</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.470" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">that really sucks that sticks out to us</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.209" end="00:03:51.150" style="s2">is<span style="s3"> that</span> about<span style="s4"> a</span> third of the counties in</p>
