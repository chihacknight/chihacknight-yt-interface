<p begin="00:09:53.930" end="00:09:57.500" style="s2">but I think that<span style="s4"> when</span> we find people who</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.060" end="00:10:00.440" style="s2">are that<span style="s3"> perfect</span> balance of<span style="s4"> pissed off</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:57.500" end="00:10:03.260" style="s2">optimist they find a lot<span style="s4"> of</span> alignment in</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.440" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">our in our in our studio challenge</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.260" end="00:10:07.400" style="s2">number two how do we maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:09.050" style="s2">sustainable business so that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.400" end="00:10:10.520" style="s2">different than just getting<span style="s3"> a</span> business</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.050" end="00:10:12.620" style="s2"><span style="s3">it may be</span> starting yet maybe even being</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.520" end="00:10:14.690" style="s2"><span style="s3">in</span> business but being sustainable I</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.620" end="00:10:18.200" style="s2">think it&#39;s also really really hard so I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.690" end="00:10:20.660" style="s2">want to maybe explain how how that works</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.200" end="00:10:22.610" style="s2">because if we if we had just<span style="s3"> described</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:20.660" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">having this world-class team world-class</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.610" end="00:10:27.350" style="s2">teams tend to require will cast salaries</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:28.580" style="s2">they want to not be given a pass like it</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.350" end="00:10:29.750" style="s2">might be fine for us to be given a pass</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.580" end="00:10:31.370" style="s2">on like oh that&#39;s a<span style="s4"> cute</span><span style="s3"> piece</span> of work</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.750" end="00:10:33.860" style="s2">but<span style="s4"> if</span> you don&#39;t<span style="s3"> get paid for it</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.370" end="00:10:37.670" style="s2">whole thing stopped very very quickly so</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.860" end="00:10:39.230" style="s2">we found<span style="s3"> that</span> in many of our so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.670" end="00:10:40.820" style="s2">traditional approaches to consulting</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.230" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">they&#39;ve been one of two kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.820" end="00:10:46.400" style="s2">reactions one is if you<span style="s4"> don&#39;t</span> have money</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.910" end="00:10:48.170" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry we can&#39;t work with you<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:46.400" end="00:10:49.490" style="s2">like it the whole conversation<span style="s3"> kind of</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:48.170" end="00:10:51.200" style="s2">comes to a grinding halt very very</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.490" end="00:10:53.300" style="s2">quickly so professional services</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:55.730" style="s2">typically has to have payment otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.300" end="00:10:57.980" style="s2">they just don&#39;t work for work with a lot</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:06.980" style="s2">is great we have a small<span style="s3"> team</span> that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.910" end="00:11:07.310" style="s2">busy right now let&#39;s organize a weekend</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.980" end="00:11:09.290" style="s2">hacker</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.310" end="00:11:10.940" style="s2">and we&#39;re<span style="s4"> going</span> to<span style="s3"> do</span><span style="s4"> very best to kind</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:09.290" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">of help<span style="s3"> you</span> guys out and we&#39;ll bust our</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.940" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">ass on getting this this piece<span style="s3"> of</span> work</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:17.690" style="s2">done and thanks very<span style="s4"> much</span> we&#39;re<span style="s3"> done</span> so</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:18.890" style="s2">once the hackathon is done people go</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.690" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">back to their regular jobs and go<span style="s4"> back</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:18.890" end="00:11:21.860" style="s2"><span style="s4">to</span> the regular<span style="s3"> lives</span> and the nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:23.540" style="s2">client is sort of left with this thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.860" end="00:11:25.160" style="s2">that they hopefully will become<span style="s4"> in</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:23.540" end="00:11:27.740" style="s2">factual<span style="s3"> and</span> hopefully we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.160" end="00:11:29.630" style="s2">long-term change I think both reactions</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.740" end="00:11:30.680" style="s2">I think a<span style="s3"> very</span> understandable and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.630" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2"><span style="s3">think</span> there&#39;s a lot<span style="s4"> of</span> value that<span style="s4"> can</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:30.680" end="00:11:34.040" style="s2">come from a hackathon and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:35.510" style="s2">surprising short amount of time but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.040" end="00:11:37.550" style="s2"><span style="s3">think</span><span style="s4"> that</span> both are hard to make</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.510" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">sustainable I think if every business</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.550" end="00:11:40.790" style="s2">did we hack up on every<span style="s4"> single</span> weekend</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:42.740" style="s2">they may be tough I don&#39;t know how many</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.790" end="00:11:44.089" style="s2">weekends you want to spend sweating with</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.740" end="00:11:45.320" style="s2">your other sweaty friends but you<span style="s3"> know</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:44.089" end="00:11:47.589" style="s2">you might want to have a regular life</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.320" end="00:11:50.000" style="s2">again so I can<span style="s3"> understand</span> why both exist</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.589" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">what we&#39;ve talked and found this in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.000" end="00:11:54.529" style="s2">visualizations that typically the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:56.300" style="s2">relationship is to have consulting</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.529" end="00:11:58.070" style="s2">consultant on one<span style="s3"> side</span><span style="s4"> and</span> then our</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.300" end="00:12:00.200" style="s2">clients who have power and the money and</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.070" end="00:12:02.990" style="s2"><span style="s4">all</span> of the decision-making<span style="s3"> power</span> on one</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.200" end="00:12:04.310" style="s2">side we<span style="s4"> end</span> up kind of on either side of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.990" end="00:12:05.990" style="s2">a<span style="s3"> table and end up so they&#39;re</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:04.310" end="00:12:10.010" style="s2">negotiating over the scope of work<span style="s3"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:05.990" end="00:12:11.720" style="s2">then<span style="s3"> maybe</span> payment the thing is i cants</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.010" end="00:12:14.240" style="s2">don&#39;t tend<span style="s3"> to</span> have that guy<span style="s4"> okay</span> they</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.720" end="00:12:15.470" style="s2">tentatively just guys that want to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:17.810" style="s2">worked happen they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.470" end="00:12:19.990" style="s2"><span style="s3">have</span> the cash with it which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.810" end="00:12:22.810" style="s2"><span style="s3">kind</span> of awkward but also awesome because</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.990" end="00:12:25.040" style="s2">we no longer are negotiating over</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.810" end="00:12:27.560" style="s2">decisions in the same way we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:29.540" style="s2">like now kind of like buddies which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.560" end="00:12:31.850" style="s2">great we&#39;re like<span style="s3"> bffs</span> with<span style="s3"> our</span> clients</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.540" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">because there&#39;s a third party that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.850" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">accepts in here which is typically a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:38.720" style="s2">funder who then has the money not</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:41.860" style="s2">necessarily<span style="s3"> the</span> power just money to fund</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.720" end="00:12:44.660" style="s2">the<span style="s3"> product</span> which means<span style="s3"> that</span> we<span style="s4"> are</span> now</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.860" end="00:12:46.640" style="s2"><span style="s4">on</span> the same side of the table which</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.660" end="00:12:48.620" style="s2"><span style="s3">before</span> in our regular consulting we</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.640" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">might<span style="s3"> not</span><span style="s4"> have</span> been this three-way</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.620" end="00:12:52.580" style="s2">relationship is totally new and that for</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:53.660" style="s2">us I wasn&#39;t<span style="s3"> having</span> them I<span style="s3"> didn&#39;t</span> really</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.580" end="00:12:56.750" style="s2"><span style="s3">have</span><span style="s4"> that</span> much experience with these</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.660" end="00:12:58.220" style="s2">sort of triangular triangulated</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.750" end="00:13:00.709" style="s2">relationships it was very very binary</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.220" end="00:13:02.600" style="s2">before but in this triangle format I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.709" end="00:13:04.610" style="s2">feel a<span style="s3"> lot</span> more alignment a kinship with</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.600" end="00:13:06.260" style="s2">our with our clients that I think we had</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.610" end="00:13:08.270" style="s2">before and<span style="s3"> their</span> negotiation over just</p>

<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:14.060" style="s2">is a very very different Asian ship than</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.170" end="00:13:15.890" style="s2">I think we&#39;d had before so that&#39;s<span style="s3"> been</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:14.060" end="00:13:17.870" style="s2">one<span style="s4"> of</span> the ways in which we found that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.890" end="00:13:19.100" style="s2">by being sustainable you can do so in</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.870" end="00:13:20.420" style="s2">this manner of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.100" end="00:13:23.390" style="s2">partnering up with your clients in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.420" end="00:13:25.790" style="s2">that perhaps felt different<span style="s3"> before</span> last</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.390" end="00:13:29.390" style="s2">one<span style="s3"> I&#39;m</span> almost there how do we align our</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.790" end="00:13:31.190" style="s2">work with our values so from me growing</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.390" end="00:13:32.840" style="s2">up I think I don&#39;t assume that there</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.190" end="00:13:36.070" style="s2">were sort of two general models for how</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.840" end="00:13:38.540" style="s2">to have value and alignment and also</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.070" end="00:13:40.190" style="s2">provide value in sort of have alignment</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.190" end="00:13:45.350" style="s2">I thought one was to just become</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.220" end="00:13:47.060" style="s2">incredibly rich somehow and then when</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.350" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">you become incredibly rich you give back</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.060" end="00:13:51.110" style="s2">to the community and that you give back</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:53.240" style="s2">in a philanthropic way or you spend<span style="s4"> your</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:51.110" end="00:13:55.900" style="s2">weekends or you do some sort of giving</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.240" end="00:13:58.970" style="s2">there&#39;s like this notion of like earn</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.970" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">ever heard of that I think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.840" end="00:14:35.330" style="s2">inflection but then the class changed</p>
