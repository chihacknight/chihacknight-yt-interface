<p begin="00:02:13.720" end="00:02:18.250" style="s2">by all three so we have what we call the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.060" end="00:02:20.290" style="s2">first a second and a third cut so it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.250" end="00:02:22.330" style="s2">go<span style="s4"> to</span><span style="s3"> the</span> first Commissioner staff that</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.580" end="00:02:39.520" style="s2">Commissioner staff and then finally if</p>

<p begin="00:02:39.520" end="00:02:43.660" style="s2">that that value needs<span style="s3"> to</span> drop it gets</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.070" end="00:02:46.090" style="s2">reduced we&#39;re completely separate from</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.660" end="00:02:47.500" style="s2">the assessor&#39;s office we really I<span style="s3"> used</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:46.090" end="00:02:49.660" style="s2">to be a federal prosecutor before I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.500" end="00:02:51.370" style="s2">this job so I<span style="s3"> always</span> explain where the</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.370" end="00:02:55.180" style="s2">court so that&#39;s really<span style="s3"> our</span></p>

<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:02.830" style="s2">have an extraordinary volume of filing</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.950" end="00:03:04.390" style="s2">so as we&#39;ll talk about in a second what</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.830" end="00:03:06.760" style="s2">started<span style="s3"> out</span> as a desire to make the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.390" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">system better we realized was a digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.760" end="00:03:12.040" style="s2">system that we needed out of necessity</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">we heard 476,000<span style="s4"> appeals</span> last year and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.040" end="00:03:16.240" style="s2">as<span style="s4"> I mentioned that&#39;s 1.4 million</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:18.250" style="s2">reviews because by statute each of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.240" end="00:03:22.450" style="s2">commissioners has to review it so it</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.250" end="00:03:24.850" style="s2">gets reviewed 3 times 10 15 years<span style="s3"> ago in</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:22.450" end="00:03:27.450" style="s2">approximately two thousand two there</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.850" end="00:03:31.090" style="s2">were 42 thousand<span style="s4"> appeals</span> last year was</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.450" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">476,000 we had in 2002 long before<span style="s3"> I</span> got</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.090" end="00:03:34.450" style="s2">there they had approximately<span style="s3"> hundred</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:36.459" style="s2">twenty four employees about<span style="s3"> a</span> nine</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.450" end="00:03:38.050" style="s2">million dollar budget now the budgets</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.459" end="00:03:40.810" style="s2">the same the head counts the same but</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.050" end="00:03:41.830" style="s2">the volume has gone up tenfold we knew</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.810" end="00:03:43.630" style="s2"><span style="s4">we</span> had<span style="s3"> to</span> do this for<span style="s3"> the</span> right reasons</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.830" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">of transparency and opening up</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.630" end="00:03:47.650" style="s2">government we also<span style="s3"> need</span> to needed that</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:50.350" style="s2">we needed to<span style="s3"> work</span> a tech system so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.650" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2">people<span style="s3"> who</span> push carts and worked with</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.350" end="00:03:56.730" style="s2">paper files got eliminated and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.750" end="00:03:56.730" style="s2"><span style="s3">converted</span> those jobs into analyst jobs</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.820" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">so one of the things Jim said we should</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.340" end="00:04:06.370" style="s2">bring is a wonderful physical prop</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:09.010" style="s2">because who doesn&#39;t love props so this</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.370" end="00:04:11.380" style="s2">is a file<span style="s4"> that</span> we used to have see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.010" end="00:04:12.450" style="s2"><span style="s3">paper</span> oh yeah if you<span style="s4"> like</span> we got a whole</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.450" end="00:04:19.060" style="s2">it starts so you would file a complaint</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:20.709" style="s2">if I can even<span style="s4"> get</span> the complaint it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.060" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">here<span style="s3"> you&#39;d</span> file a paper complaint which</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.709" end="00:04:27.039" style="s2">by the way was in triplicate and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">file a complaint it would come<span style="s3"> in</span> we&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:04:34.629" end="00:04:37.900" style="s2">jacket and then all<span style="s4"> the</span> evidence<span style="s3"> that</span></p>

<p begin="00:21:25.100" end="00:21:30.230" style="s2">and then you know what what you can see</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.950" end="00:21:31.760" style="s2">within each one of those files so for</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.230" end="00:21:34.700" style="s2">something that we were doing<span style="s4"> where</span> we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.700" end="00:21:40.340" style="s2">where were then adding something<span style="s4"> to</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.520" end="00:21:42.290" style="s2">file and then moving along this was the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.340" end="00:21:43.640" style="s2"><span style="s3">perfect</span> platform for us from just<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:42.290" end="00:21:46.790" style="s2">just<span style="s3"> out</span> of the box and then we</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.640" end="00:21:49.790" style="s2">configured it a little bit but but it</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.790" end="00:21:53.240" style="s2">all of that all<span style="s4"> of</span><span style="s3"> this</span> data was then</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.790" end="00:21:54.920" style="s2">was then<span style="s4"> auto-filled</span> through through the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.240" end="00:21:56.660" style="s2">mainframe and through the cobalt system</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.920" end="00:21:58.310" style="s2">it pulled did a nightly job and just</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.660" end="00:22:02.180" style="s2">kind of pulled everything every night</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.310" end="00:22:04.250" style="s2">that&#39;s our phase two is to stop that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.180" end="00:22:07.250" style="s2">so we had and that really kind of was at</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.250" end="00:22:09.530" style="s2"><span style="s3">times</span> a one of the largest hurdles that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.250" end="00:22:11.960" style="s2">we had was because we were trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.530" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">to interact with<span style="s3"> the</span> very old technology</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.960" end="00:22:16.580" style="s2">with a very new technology which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:19.090" style="s2">always they think you guys know is one</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.580" end="00:22:23.090" style="s2">of the biggest challenges if we all have</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.090" end="00:22:25.190" style="s2">but but as you can see it really it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.090" end="00:22:27.290" style="s2">provided<span style="s3"> the information that we needed</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:25.190" end="00:22:29.150" style="s2">in the middle it<span style="s3"> provided</span> access to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.290" end="00:22:31.430" style="s2">everything that an analyst needed to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.150" end="00:22:36.470" style="s2">make a decision<span style="s3"> but</span> we&#39;ll go to the<span style="s3"> next</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:31.430" end="00:22:39.110" style="s2"><span style="s4">one</span> to<span style="s4"> show</span> you kind of how these<span style="s3"> are</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:36.470" end="00:22:41.930" style="s2">the<span style="s4"> results</span> so go<span style="s3"> back</span><span style="s4"> to</span> the page where</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.110" end="00:22:44.690" style="s2">people were drawing and kind<span style="s3"> of</span> writing</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.930" end="00:22:46.730" style="s2">on now when when you<span style="s3"> pull</span> this up when</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.690" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">we<span style="s3"> get</span> a foil result<span style="s3"> with it when that</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:46.730" end="00:22:53.150" style="s2"><span style="s3">when</span> that comes in you<span style="s4"> can</span> read who did</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:55.370" style="s2">it<span style="s3"> what</span> what the number was what the why</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.150" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">they did it but then also what some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.370" end="00:22:58.280" style="s2">the<span style="s3"> analysts</span> did is they expand on it</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:00.850" style="s2">didn&#39;t like the fact that they were</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.280" end="00:23:04.910" style="s2">limited by these boxes so the endless</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.850" end="00:23:07.010" style="s2">decided to use OneNote and they applied</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.910" end="00:23:09.830" style="s2">one though and<span style="s3"> they</span> and they copied it</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.010" end="00:23:14.090" style="s2">into their files so now go back to hid</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.830" end="00:23:15.830" style="s2">open that we go back to<span style="s4"> this</span> so what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.090" end="00:23:18.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t know was well we were building it</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.830" end="00:23:21.650" style="s2">we realized we had four years of what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.950" end="00:23:23.690" style="s2">call priors the<span style="s4"> prior year files so</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:21.650" end="00:23:25.910" style="s2">while it was being built<span style="s3"> we</span> took all</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.690" end="00:23:27.950" style="s2">these folks who used to be the back</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.910" end="00:23:30.770" style="s2">office folks pushing carts and doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.950" end="00:23:33.050" style="s2">other things and said<span style="s3"> listen</span> you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.770" end="00:23:35.330" style="s2">going to be imaging four years worth of</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.050" end="00:23:37.250" style="s2">just<span style="s3"> the</span> decision page so this<span style="s3"> is</span> what</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.330" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">you see right here the decision page the</p>

<p begin="00:23:40.370" end="00:23:44.630" style="s2">that&#39;s my value so Jim&#39;s point is our</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.440" end="00:23:46.910" style="s2"><span style="s3">folks</span> said listen let&#39;s image it put it</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.630" end="00:23:49.280" style="s2"><span style="s3">in</span> the OneNote and that way we can have</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.340" end="00:24:20.630" style="s2">really really walk people down<span style="s4"> to</span> how</p>
