<p begin="00:09:21.619" end="00:09:26.329" style="s2">organizations it&#39;s all broken in silos</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.779" end="00:09:27.829" style="s2">so here we are changing that the second</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.329" end="00:09:30.319" style="s2">one is<span style="s4"> improving</span> the business of the</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.499" end="00:09:42.920" style="s2">the third<span style="s3"> thing</span><span style="s4"> that</span> we<span style="s3"> are</span> working in</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.879" end="00:09:44.569" style="s2">parallel is the areas where we<span style="s3"> can</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:42.920" end="00:09:48.170" style="s2">actually leapfrog so many other states</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.569" end="00:09:49.639" style="s2"><span style="s4">good</span> thing is in technology fortunately</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.170" end="00:09:51.889" style="s2">unfortunately we are kind<span style="s4"> of</span> the third</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.290" end="00:14:56.210" style="s2">different systems so what they basically</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.090" end="00:14:58.130" style="s2">have to do is don&#39;t try<span style="s4"> to</span> read this</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.510" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">to go through ten different mainframe</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.030" end="00:15:04.640" style="s2">based systems all different green</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:06.950" style="s2">screens they searched all of these</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.990" end="00:15:13.640" style="s2">then they start kind of marking these</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.430" end="00:15:15.710" style="s2">things oh this is a that<span style="s3"> guy&#39;s</span> this</p>

<p begin="00:15:20.990" end="00:15:25.640" style="s2">takes them days to figure out like</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.570" end="00:15:27.620" style="s2">figuring out what kind<span style="s4"> of</span> relationships</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.190" end="00:20:59.230" style="s2">why I need a CDO to start focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.380" end="00:21:01.150" style="s2">that is improve our presence in open</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.230" end="00:21:03.250" style="s2">data I mean we have I have not even</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.080" end="00:21:09.190" style="s2">months but once the CDO comes on board</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.030" end="00:21:11.800" style="s2">one of the charters that the CD of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.190" end="00:21:15.190" style="s2">have will<span style="s3"> be</span> to improve our presence on</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.990" end="00:26:09.010" style="s2">procurement so we need to get<span style="s4"> that</span> data</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.580" end="00:26:11.230" style="s2">out of so will basically retire 300</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.010" end="00:26:14.730" style="s2">technologies but<span style="s4"> will</span> bring that data</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.039" end="00:31:37.580" style="s2">except one guy stood up so they are all</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.019" end="00:31:39.349" style="s2">now working together so while they<span style="s4"> have</span></p>

<p begin="00:31:39.349" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">they also have enterprise<span style="s4"> responsibility</span></p>
<p begin="00:31:41.629" end="00:31:47.979" style="s2">that never happened in<span style="s4"> the</span> state before</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:47.979" style="s2">question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.880" end="00:32:05.500" style="s2">so<span style="s4"> procurement</span> whatever I mean<span style="s4"> people</span></p>
<p begin="00:32:03.700" end="00:32:07.270" style="s2">say procurement is difficult in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.500" end="00:32:09.670" style="s2">state i mean there&#39;s lots of things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.270" end="00:32:10.690" style="s2">have been said about and that always<span style="s3"> i</span></p>
<p begin="00:32:09.670" end="00:32:13.960" style="s2"><span style="s4">mean</span> the government people say</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.690" end="00:32:16.810" style="s2"><span style="s3">procurement</span> very slow so it&#39;s<span style="s4"> not</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.960" end="00:32:19.210" style="s2">fault of procurement department or</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.810" end="00:32:20.530" style="s2">whoever is running procurement majority</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.210" end="00:32:22.180" style="s2">of the time that gets spent on</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.530" end="00:32:23.650" style="s2">procurement is spent by the buying</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.180" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">department because the buying</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.650" end="00:32:26.860" style="s2">departments the one who&#39;s writing the</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:28.360" style="s2"><span style="s3">rfp</span> the buying department is the one who</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.860" end="00:32:29.980" style="s2">is<span style="s4"> evaluating</span> the responses and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.360" end="00:32:31.990" style="s2">negotiating and awarding the contract</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.980" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">and getting them on board the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.990" end="00:32:37.330" style="s2">procurement itself is four to six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:38.740" style="s2">so all the bad rap that<span style="s4"> the</span> procurement</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.330" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">gets actually it&#39;s the buying</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.740" end="00:32:42.670" style="s2">departments that are delaying everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:45.310" style="s2">now there<span style="s4"> are</span> some peculiarities in</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.670" end="00:32:46.900" style="s2"><span style="s4">state</span> procurement rules that we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.310" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2"><span style="s4">trying to figure</span> out how can<span style="s3"> we</span> can</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.900" end="00:32:54.580" style="s2">improve but no<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> build versus<span style="s4"> by</span> is</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:57.790" style="s2">not the bill versus my strategy is more</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.580" end="00:33:00.100" style="s2">so<span style="s3"> that</span> we have<span style="s4"> invested</span> so much in our</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.790" end="00:33:03.100" style="s2">employees we want to<span style="s4"> make</span> sure<span style="s4"> that</span> we</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:07.450" style="s2">there for a purpose they are all there</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.950" end="00:33:09.730" style="s2">for public service so<span style="s4"> we</span> want to give</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.730" end="00:33:16.120" style="s2">build and then if that doesn&#39;t<span style="s3"> work</span> out</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.370" end="00:33:18.850" style="s2">then we<span style="s4"> always</span> have the buy option there</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.120" end="00:33:21.540" style="s2">was a I saw somebody had a<span style="s4"> question</span> oh</p>
