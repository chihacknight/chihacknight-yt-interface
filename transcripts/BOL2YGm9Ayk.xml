<p begin="00:35:48.309" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">there was sort of clarity of focus there</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.079" end="00:35:55.900" style="s2">and<span style="s3"> ultimately</span> we were trying to<span style="s3"> do</span> a</p>

<p begin="00:36:31.150" end="00:36:37.450" style="s2">in other cases we we did it<span style="s4"> a</span> project in</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.079" end="00:36:53.710" style="s2">really have impact on the problem they</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:55.719" style="s2">were trying<span style="s3"> to</span> solve and that probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.710" end="00:36:58.749" style="s2">accounts for a lot a lot<span style="s4"> of</span> the times</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.719" end="00:37:00.969" style="s2">were we kind of swing and<span style="s3"> miss</span> you know</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.139" end="00:37:15.339" style="s2">about<span style="s3"> they&#39;ll try</span><span style="s4"> X</span> we very often end up</p>

<p begin="00:37:20.799" end="00:37:25.689" style="s2">is<span style="s4"> something</span> we&#39;re trying to figure<span style="s4"> out</span></p>

<p begin="00:37:53.530" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">so there&#39;s sort of two questions in<span style="s3"> that</span></p>

<p begin="00:38:04.430" end="00:38:10.910" style="s2">that is in California is no I can say</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.180" end="00:38:12.700" style="s2">that<span style="s3"> really</span> confidently and I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.910" end="00:38:14.750" style="s2">you why it snow in California</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.700" end="00:38:17.720" style="s2">particularly but I think it should<span style="s4"> be</span><span style="s3"> no</span></p>

<p begin="00:38:34.670" end="00:38:39.380" style="s2">like we frankly haven&#39;t really worked in</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.650" end="00:38:40.820" style="s2">those places in California the reason</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.380" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">people<span style="s4"> don&#39;t</span> get food stamps isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.820" end="00:38:45.640" style="s2">because people are trying<span style="s3"> not</span> to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:48.349" style="s2">them it&#39;s because<span style="s4"> the</span> process is broken</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.390" end="00:39:03.640" style="s2">when so there&#39;s there&#39;s um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.090" end="00:39:08.900" style="s2">policy that we hear about<span style="s4"> in</span> the news</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.250" end="00:39:12.530" style="s2">and then there&#39;s<span style="s4"> like</span> policy on<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
