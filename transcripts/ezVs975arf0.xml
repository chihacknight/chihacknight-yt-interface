<p begin="00:25:29.700" end="00:25:34.290" style="s2">think and the city<span style="s3"> has</span> said in open</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.430" end="00:25:35.730" style="s2">court they don&#39;t maintain this anymore</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.290" end="00:25:37.590" style="s2">they&#39;ve changed their tune but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.730" end="00:25:39.690" style="s2">said in open court many times that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.590" end="00:25:41.250" style="s2">don&#39;t look<span style="s3"> at</span> these patterns they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.690" end="00:25:41.970" style="s2">look at an officer&#39;s past history of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.250" end="00:25:44.100" style="s2">Miss Conda</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.970" end="00:25:46.140" style="s2">they don&#39;t single out officers for</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.100" end="00:25:47.670" style="s2">interventions or training like some</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.140" end="00:25:50.070" style="s2">early warning program based on</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.670" end="00:25:54.090" style="s2">allegations and so I think that<span style="s3"> this</span> is</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.070" end="00:25:57.780" style="s2">a lot of like untapped important<span style="s3"> Civic</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:54.090" end="00:26:00.230" style="s2">data as<span style="s3"> to</span> like identifying false</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.780" end="00:26:07.800" style="s2">allegations you mean like trying<span style="s4"> to</span><span style="s3"> find</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:00.230" end="00:26:09.420" style="s2">like<span style="s4"> hard</span> yeah yeah and I also<span style="s4"> say</span> that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.800" end="00:26:11.310" style="s2">the people<span style="s3"> who</span> have made complaints</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.420" end="00:26:14.610" style="s2">their personal information is redacted</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.310" end="00:26:16.560" style="s2">it&#39;s done so by the city we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.610" end="00:26:19.020" style="s2">redact any of the information ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.560" end="00:26:21.930" style="s2">so that&#39;s all redaction done we publish</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.020" end="00:26:23.490" style="s2">it as we get it with some cleaning like</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.930" end="00:26:26.880" style="s2">Lin Lang and matching and<span style="s3"> things</span> like</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.490" end="00:26:31.290" style="s2">that what about<span style="s4"> a</span> hospital you<span style="s4"> don&#39;t eat</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:26.880" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">with photos yes I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.290" end="00:26:42.720" style="s2">crowdsourcing if you see yeah we&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:44.760" style="s2">interested in this and not just photos</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.720" end="00:26:46.590" style="s2">so like the the police department</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.760" end="00:26:49.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t release officer photos they</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.590" end="00:26:51.210" style="s2">claim some like safety stuff but<span style="s3"> even</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:49.650" end="00:26:52.890" style="s2">when they do release officer photos</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.210" end="00:26:54.660" style="s2">they&#39;re usually like the day the recruit</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.890" end="00:26:56.400" style="s2">graduated from the<span style="s3"> Academy and it&#39;s like</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:54.660" end="00:26:58.710" style="s2"><span style="s3">very</span> difficult to make identifications</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.400" end="00:27:00.420" style="s2">off of that so we&#39;re we&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.710" end="00:27:02.250" style="s2">photos we&#39;re also interested in ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.420" end="00:27:04.950" style="s2">that police officers are identifying</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.250" end="00:27:06.750" style="s2">themselves so one project<span style="s4"> that</span> we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.950" end="00:27:07.770" style="s2">communicated with in England started</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.750" end="00:27:10.830" style="s2">this thing in their local municipality</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.770" end="00:27:13.290" style="s2">where every time an officer interacts</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.830" end="00:27:16.380" style="s2">with someone they say into their radio I</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.290" end="00:27:18.720" style="s2">am officer so-and-so my badge number is</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.380" end="00:27:21.630" style="s2">this and I&#39;ve stopped a person because</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.720" end="00:27:23.430" style="s2">and they say the<span style="s4"> reason</span> and it does some</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.630" end="00:27:25.080" style="s2">important things which is<span style="s3"> like</span><span style="s4"> everybody</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:23.430" end="00:27:27.810" style="s2">knows that the<span style="s3"> police officer is on</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:25.080" end="00:27:29.730" style="s2"><span style="s4">record</span> at that point and being in<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:27.810" end="00:27:31.410" style="s2">location you hear the badge number in</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.730" end="00:27:33.000" style="s2">the name out loud and<span style="s4"> you</span> also hear the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.410" end="00:27:34.770" style="s2">reason you&#39;re being stopped we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.000" end="00:27:36.570" style="s2">make that requirement of officers here</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.770" end="00:27:38.970" style="s2">but I<span style="s4"> think</span> we easily could it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.570" end="00:27:40.470" style="s2">like a super<span style="s3"> low-tech</span> solution a number</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.970" end="00:27:43.140" style="s2">another one would<span style="s4"> be</span> if their badge</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.470" end="00:27:45.570" style="s2">numbers were just easier<span style="s4"> to</span> read like if</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.140" end="00:27:47.370" style="s2">instead of<span style="s3"> being</span> tiny shiny metal things</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.570" end="00:27:49.490" style="s2">they were like big velcro numbers on</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.370" end="00:27:51.960" style="s2">your back<span style="s4"> or</span> something<span style="s3"> like</span> that<span style="s3"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:49.490" end="00:27:54.300" style="s2">another<span style="s3"> one</span> is like QR codes on their</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.960" end="00:27:56.490" style="s2">back this is one that<span style="s3"> Roger you loves</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:54.300" end="00:27:57.930" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re just like<span style="s4"> QR code an</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:56.490" end="00:28:00.060" style="s2">officer we talk all the time about</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.930" end="00:28:02.340" style="s2">things like uber for police departments</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.060" end="00:28:03.690" style="s2">like if you called the<span style="s3"> police</span> and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.340" end="00:28:05.250" style="s2">could see how long it was going to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.690" end="00:28:07.140" style="s2">them<span style="s3"> to</span> get to you and who your officer</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.250" end="00:28:08.820" style="s2">would be and also<span style="s3"> what</span> type of special</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.140" end="00:28:10.500" style="s2">training they had like officers are</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.820" end="00:28:13.500" style="s2">diversifying and some are more qualified</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.500" end="00:28:15.420" style="s2">in certain areas than others and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.500" end="00:28:16.800" style="s2">if they had like a few called for</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.420" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">domestic violence<span style="s3"> and they were bringing</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:16.800" end="00:28:20.700" style="s2">a domestic violence<span style="s3"> advocate</span> with them</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:23.070" style="s2">you could see that information so<span style="s4"> I</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:20.700" end="00:28:24.810" style="s2">think we&#39;re very interested in it how</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.070" end="00:28:26.370" style="s2">much of<span style="s4"> it</span> is forcing the city to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.810" end="00:28:28.950" style="s2">release information how much of it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.370" end="00:28:32.610" style="s2">like crowdsourcing is a an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.950" end="00:28:34.230" style="s2">question i think we don&#39;t<span style="s3"> have</span> any we</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.230" end="00:28:39.690" style="s2">yet and we&#39;re thinking<span style="s4"> about</span> it<span style="s4"> but</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:37.530" end="00:28:43.080" style="s2">we&#39;re also hesitant to be mixing like</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.690" end="00:28:44.340" style="s2">official sources with crowdsource or we</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.080" end="00:28:48.420" style="s2">just<span style="s3"> want</span> to do it<span style="s4"> the</span> right way you</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.340" end="00:28:51.710" style="s2">know<span style="s4"> like be thoughtful about it Wow</span></p>

<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:53.510" style="s2"><span style="s4">question</span> is kind of like can<span style="s4"> you</span> track</p>

<p begin="00:31:53.510" end="00:31:58.610" style="s2">things over time so we just received a</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.690" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">their unit assignments the trouble is</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.490" end="00:32:13.730" style="s2">connecting it up with a rest data and</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:15.980" style="s2">arrest data though lots of it is public</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.730" end="00:32:17.510" style="s2"><span style="s4">it&#39;s</span> public and sort<span style="s3"> of anonymized so</span></p>
<p begin="00:32:15.980" end="00:32:20.059" style="s2">it&#39;s<span style="s3"> very</span> hard to connect like a rest</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.059" end="00:32:25.340" style="s2">locations that data is given to people</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.730" end="00:32:29.000" style="s2">like they have that<span style="s3"> data</span> like the crime</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.340" end="00:32:30.950" style="s2">lab gets it for example but<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span><span style="s4"> not</span></p>

<p begin="00:32:57.320" end="00:33:00.860" style="s2"><span style="s4">probably</span> the best place to start as</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.600" end="00:33:05.840" style="s2">decree because a lot of those<span style="s3"> cities</span></p>

<p begin="00:40:59.960" end="00:41:03.950" style="s2">online like it&#39;s<span style="s3"> starting</span> to build a</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.820" end="00:41:05.810" style="s2">record<span style="s3"> and</span> that<span style="s3"> record</span> is visible and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.950" end="00:41:07.700" style="s2">then he&#39;s going<span style="s3"> to</span> go make a complaint</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.810" end="00:41:09.859" style="s2">so that his complaint can appear online</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.700" end="00:41:11.810" style="s2">and other people can see<span style="s4"> what it is</span><span style="s3"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:41:09.859" end="00:41:14.900" style="s2">so I<span style="s4"> think</span> there&#39;s something about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.810" end="00:41:17.510" style="s2">like visibility that<span style="s3"> really</span> matters to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.900" end="00:41:20.030" style="s2"><span style="s4">the</span> process of making a complaint so</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.510" end="00:41:22.220" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing I think is big</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.030" end="00:41:24.710" style="s2">lawsuit I don&#39;t know since the DOJ is in</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.220" end="00:41:34.130" style="s2">town we&#39;ll probably have to<span style="s4"> wait</span> I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.710" end="00:41:37.790" style="s2">take<span style="s3"> the</span> one that seems pretty light</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.130" end="00:41:40.820" style="s2">within the software information li</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.790" end="00:41:42.829" style="s2">Tsung&#39;s our question game yeah you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.820" end="00:41:44.089" style="s2">any indication I mean my question<span style="s3"> Jimmy</span></p>
<p begin="00:41:42.829" end="00:41:54.170" style="s2">in addition that that&#39;s<span style="s4"> happening</span> that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.089" end="00:41:55.730" style="s2">was Nikki we&#39;re like talking about<span style="s3"> all</span> I</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.170" end="00:41:56.990" style="s2">think he<span style="s3"> doesn&#39;t</span> mean Jamie used to</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.730" end="00:41:59.119" style="s2">write about<span style="s3"> him</span> all the time back<span style="s3"> in</span></p>
<p begin="00:41:56.990" end="00:42:01.310" style="s2">public housing and he did not seem fazed</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.119" end="00:42:03.319" style="s2">by the celebrity I think the question</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.310" end="00:42:05.150" style="s2">the like mechanics of accountability are</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.319" end="00:42:06.950" style="s2">just fascinating like the city<span style="s3"> spent</span></p>
<p begin="00:42:05.150" end="00:42:09.109" style="s2"><span style="s3">over</span> a half billion<span style="s4"> dollars</span> in<span style="s4"> the</span> last</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.950" end="00:42:12.109" style="s2">decade on police misconduct settlements</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.109" end="00:42:14.390" style="s2">not including legal fees it&#39;s a serious</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.109" end="00:42:16.069" style="s2">cost to the city there<span style="s3"> are</span> lots<span style="s3"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:42:14.390" end="00:42:18.440" style="s2">little things that<span style="s3"> prevent</span> them<span style="s4"> from</span></p>
<p begin="00:42:16.069" end="00:42:20.660" style="s2">using that against a police officer</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.440" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">because of the police contract police</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.660" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">officers have more due process than then</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:27.319" style="s2">kids have<span style="s4"> than</span> the mentally ill have</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:29.740" style="s2">been some of<span style="s3"> the</span> most vulnerable people</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.319" end="00:42:32.180" style="s2">in our society have they have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.740" end="00:42:36.050" style="s2">mechanical protections and those</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.180" end="00:42:38.450" style="s2">contracts but yeah like when you sign a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.050" end="00:42:41.720" style="s2">settlement 45 million dollars does</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.450" end="00:42:43.700" style="s2">anyone call Jason van Dyke and say like</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.720" end="00:42:45.800" style="s2">you&#39;re on<span style="s3"> the</span> line<span style="s4"> now</span> we&#39;re<span style="s3"> going to</span></p>
<p begin="00:42:43.700" end="00:42:48.950" style="s2">investigate you as far as I know that</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.800" end="00:42:50.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen Jason van Dyke was working</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.950" end="00:42:54.530" style="s2">maybe on dust you do but was working</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.780" end="00:42:57.380" style="s2">with no interference to his job pending</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.530" end="00:43:00.050" style="s2"><span style="s4">the</span> outcome of that investigation and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.380" end="00:43:02.089" style="s2">I<span style="s3"> think</span> this data is really shining a</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.050" end="00:43:03.390" style="s2">light on how little happens<span style="s3"> like</span> how</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.089" end="00:43:05.910" style="s2">much impunity</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.390" end="00:43:08.099" style="s2">there is and<span style="s4"> how</span> serious those</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.910" end="00:43:09.779" style="s2">protections are and it&#39;s nice to think</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.099" end="00:43:11.369" style="s2">now we&#39;re in a moment the sort<span style="s3"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:43:09.779" end="00:43:12.660" style="s2">political moment where people are moving</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.369" end="00:43:14.279" style="s2">on it and some<span style="s3"> of</span> those protections</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.660" end="00:43:15.480" style="s2">might fall but the truth is that<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:43:14.279" end="00:43:19.289" style="s2">union contracts not up for negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.480" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">till 2017 and it&#39;s possible<span style="s3"> then</span> in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.289" end="00:43:22.349" style="s2">police accountability is not all over</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">the news and all over<span style="s3"> the</span> median and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.349" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">those contract negotiations are going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:27.299" style="s2">have to be<span style="s3"> taken</span> up by the political</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:30.690" style="s2">representatives who already did those</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.299" end="00:43:31.680" style="s2">negotiations like our<span style="s4"> alderman</span> I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.690" end="00:43:34.049" style="s2">know I&#39;m like getting really scattered</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.680" end="00:43:36.359" style="s2">now but I<span style="s3"> just think</span><span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> like a really</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.049" end="00:43:38.519" style="s2">complicated question those little things</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.359" end="00:43:41.609" style="s2">really matter and some<span style="s3"> of</span> these</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.519" end="00:43:43.170" style="s2">documents<span style="s3"> can</span> shed light on it all right</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.609" end="00:43:45.000" style="s2"><span style="s3">maybe</span> like insurance companies for</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.170" end="00:43:46.289" style="s2">police departments maybe we&#39;ll<span style="s4"> see</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.000" end="00:43:48.950" style="s2">standard practice come out of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.289" end="00:43:55.519" style="s2">federal<span style="s4"> government but we haven&#39;t yet I</span></p>
<p begin="00:43:48.950" end="00:43:55.519" style="s2">don&#39;t know those<span style="s3"> are</span> last question</p>
