<p begin="00:12:14.610" end="00:12:19.589" style="s2">we&#39;re collecting we have our data</p>

<p begin="00:12:31.950" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">that this diagram is<span style="s4"> probably</span> common or</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.829" end="00:12:38.490" style="s2">probably<span style="s3"> could</span> be used in many different</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.300" end="00:12:57.930" style="s2">challenges are that<span style="s3"> almost</span> none<span style="s4"> of</span> it</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.070" end="00:13:00.870" style="s2">exists at heartland alliance so if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.930" end="00:13:02.670" style="s2">look at this data flow knowledge flow</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.870" end="00:13:07.320" style="s2">not really working too well and<span style="s3"> a</span> lot<span style="s4"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:02.670" end="00:13:09.300" style="s2"><span style="s3">vaporware up there but so so underneath</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:07.320" end="00:13:11.880" style="s2">those five organizations we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.300" end="00:13:15.150" style="s2">somewhere upwards of 110 programs those</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.880" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">110 programs have their 110 funders<span style="s3"> plus</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:15.150" end="00:13:19.460" style="s2">right so all of<span style="s3"> that</span> data collection is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:22.140" style="s2">happening for that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.460" end="00:13:23.910" style="s2">and we also don&#39;t necessarily have a</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.910" end="00:13:31.230" style="s2">programs Excel access PDF files<span style="s3"> these</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:29.400" end="00:13:38.100" style="s2">types of dates right so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.230" end="00:13:41.430" style="s2">systems and in addition to that we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.100" end="00:13:44.580" style="s2">the the challenge of operating in five</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.430" end="00:13:46.350" style="s2">different industries right so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.580" end="00:13:49.800" style="s2">services that<span style="s3"> we</span> provide range from law</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.350" end="00:13:51.720" style="s2">firms to property developers to<span style="s3"> health</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:49.800" end="00:13:53.940" style="s2"><span style="s4">care</span> providers how do<span style="s3"> you</span> find a single</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.720" end="00:13:57.170" style="s2"><span style="s3">system</span> or a data system of record for</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.940" end="00:13:59.760" style="s2">all of those organizations right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.170" end="00:14:01.560" style="s2">lastly this data infrastructure bi</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.760" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">infrastructure just doesn&#39;t exist at all</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.560" end="00:14:05.100" style="s2">so this is<span style="s4"> the</span> challenge<span style="s4"> that</span> we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:07.520" style="s2">facing and that we&#39;re<span style="s3"> trying</span> to work</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.100" end="00:14:10.710" style="s2">through right now so where are we at</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.520" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">right now we&#39;re making a map huh this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.710" end="00:14:14.790" style="s2">middle-earth we could have<span style="s3"> used</span> Westeros</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:15.780" style="s2">but I think<span style="s4"> you</span> get<span style="s4"> the</span> point here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.790" end="00:14:17.700" style="s2"><span style="s4">trying</span><span style="s3"> to</span> get<span style="s3"> a sense and get our</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:15.780" end="00:14:20.700" style="s2">bearings of where and how<span style="s3"> to</span> approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.700" end="00:14:22.860" style="s2">this challenge right but we do think</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.700" end="00:14:24.690" style="s2">that it&#39;s a worthy endeavor even if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.860" end="00:14:26.430" style="s2">look back at that other slide and see</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.690" end="00:14:27.900" style="s2">that there&#39;s so much work<span style="s3"> to</span> do<span style="s3"> because</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:26.430" end="00:14:29.820" style="s2"><span style="s3">of</span> the breadth<span style="s3"> of</span> our<span style="s3"> services</span> we feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.900" end="00:14:32.520" style="s2">like we have a unique data opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.820" end="00:14:34.590" style="s2">to uncover something and truly<span style="s3"> innovate</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:32.520" end="00:14:36.750" style="s2">in the industry<span style="s4"> that</span> we&#39;re in right so</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.590" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">we think<span style="s4"> that</span> moving from outputs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.750" end="00:14:40.860" style="s2">outcomes is going to be something<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:38.610" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">we&#39;re going<span style="s3"> to be able to</span> do we think</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.860" end="00:14:43.560" style="s2">that<span style="s3"> those</span> outcomes combined together</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:45.900" style="s2">are going to be<span style="s4"> able</span> to show how we are</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.560" end="00:14:48.510" style="s2">impacting communities we also think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.900" end="00:14:51.750" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to uncover the mix of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.510" end="00:14:53.610" style="s2">services<span style="s4"> that</span> will move the needle the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.750" end="00:14:55.200" style="s2">most for ending poverty and we think</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.610" end="00:14:57.300" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> our data systems will allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.200" end="00:15:01.080" style="s2">actually connect people more quickly to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.300" end="00:15:04.620" style="s2">move them through those services so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.080" end="00:15:07.470" style="s2"><span style="s4">think</span> we have<span style="s3"> a</span> unique opportunity given</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.620" end="00:15:09.840" style="s2">given that breadth of service so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.470" end="00:15:11.640" style="s2">things that<span style="s4"> are</span> keeping us up at night</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.840" end="00:15:13.170" style="s2">right now are the key questions as we</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.640" end="00:15:15.870" style="s2">try to start moving through this process</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.170" end="00:15:17.730" style="s2">is just really what can<span style="s3"> we</span> learn from</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.870" end="00:15:20.000" style="s2">other industries that are maybe further</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.730" end="00:15:25.260" style="s2">along<span style="s4"> in the innovation</span><span style="s3"> and learning</span></p>

<p begin="00:15:29.700" end="00:15:32.579" style="s2">what can we<span style="s3"> do</span><span style="s4"> now</span> because<span style="s3"> we</span> know<span style="s4"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:31.740" end="00:15:33.929" style="s2">that vapor</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.929" end="00:15:38.399" style="s2">build what can we<span style="s4"> do</span> with the<span style="s3"> data</span> sets</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.329" end="00:15:39.720" style="s2">that we have right now to begin and to</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.100" end="00:15:49.709" style="s2">us and then lastly when is enough on the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.029" end="00:15:52.709" style="s2">planning and when<span style="s3"> can</span> we just start</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.709" end="00:15:54.779" style="s2">doing so you know this<span style="s3"> is</span><span style="s4"> a</span><span style="s3"> little</span> bit</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.430" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">term that&#39;s where we&#39;re hoping<span style="s4"> to</span> go do</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.960" end="00:25:15.179" style="s2">case studies of organizations<span style="s3"> that</span> have</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.570" end="00:25:20.519" style="s2">done that and really have changed their</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.179" end="00:25:23.880" style="s2">relationship with funders it&#39;s a<span style="s3"> great</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:20.519" end="00:25:26.340" style="s2">question yeah I<span style="s3"> wonder</span> if anyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.880" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">field is<span style="s3"> that</span> it&#39;s quite<span style="s3"> that</span> far along</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.340" end="00:25:30.269" style="s2">I&#39;m one of the things on our to-do list</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:31.350" style="s2">is to go out and<span style="s4"> visit</span> some</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.269" end="00:25:33.960" style="s2">organizations that have gone through</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.350" end="00:25:36.510" style="s2">kind of a technology change like the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.960" end="00:25:37.740" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking<span style="s3"> of</span> I think<span style="s4"> all</span> of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.510" end="00:25:38.850" style="s2">ones that we&#39;re thinking you go I got</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.740" end="00:25:40.080" style="s2">visiting or so much smaller<span style="s3"> than</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:38.850" end="00:25:42.769" style="s2"><span style="s3">Heartland</span> like it all seems so much</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.080" end="00:25:45.690" style="s2">easier at some<span style="s3"> single-issue</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:42.769" end="00:25:47.130" style="s2">organizations and the like so I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.690" end="00:25:49.110" style="s2"><span style="s3">that&#39;s</span> going to be an actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.130" end="00:25:50.399" style="s2">interesting question to start probing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.110" end="00:25:53.700" style="s2">with some of these organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.399" end="00:25:57.149" style="s2">were going<span style="s3"> to</span> be talking with is if and</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.700" end="00:25:59.960" style="s2">how this has been impacting their their</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.149" end="00:26:02.820" style="s2">funding conversations certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.960" end="00:26:05.010" style="s2">Nevers have made their operational<span style="s4"> day</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:02.820" end="00:26:07.080" style="s2"><span style="s4">to day function better there you know</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:05.010" end="00:26:08.940" style="s2">able to reach more people or do it at a</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.080" end="00:26:10.919" style="s2">lower cost and those kinds of things<span style="s3"> but</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:08.940" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">actually influencing funders I think is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.919" end="00:26:19.580" style="s2">that last piece that I don&#39;t know<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:19.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve seen<span style="s3"> that</span> yet sure</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.500" end="00:26:42.130" style="s2">so that&#39;s a great question a lot<span style="s3"> of</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.580" end="00:26:44.290" style="s2"><span style="s3">data</span> that&#39;s already being collected not</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.130" end="00:26:47.770" style="s2">for the use for the purposes of<span style="s3"> this</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:44.290" end="00:26:49.690" style="s2">exercise right is being you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.770" end="00:26:51.850" style="s2">a<span style="s3"> business</span> associate<span style="s3"> agreement</span> with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.690" end="00:26:53.410" style="s2">groups that we&#39;re storing it with or how</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.850" end="00:26:55.690" style="s2">we&#39;re collecting it we&#39;re HIPAA</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.410" end="00:26:58.900" style="s2">regulated so we do take security privacy</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.690" end="00:27:00.820" style="s2">all of<span style="s3"> that</span> very serious we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.900" end="00:27:04.210" style="s2">necessarily gone to that next level for</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.820" end="00:27:05.830" style="s2">the research or the IRB review process</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.210" end="00:27:06.790" style="s2">or those types of things I know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.830" end="00:27:08.980" style="s2"><span style="s3">probably</span> have a<span style="s3"> little</span> bit more</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.790" end="00:27:10.919" style="s2"><span style="s4">experience</span> with<span style="s4"> that</span> but we do take the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.980" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">data collection process very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.919" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">and you&#39;re<span style="s4"> talking</span> about<span style="s3"> how</span> it might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:20.830" style="s2">it might be not as reliable of data yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:24.250" style="s2">you know I mean like<span style="s3"> I</span> said we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.830" end="00:27:25.870" style="s2">remotely there yet so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.250" end="00:27:29.230" style="s2"><span style="s3">something</span> that when we talk about data</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.870" end="00:27:32.470" style="s2">governance is going to be kind of top of</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.230" end="00:27:35.110" style="s2">mind hopefully we&#39;ll be able<span style="s3"> to</span> fix some</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.470" end="00:27:39.340" style="s2">of the unreliability through really</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.110" end="00:27:41.410" style="s2">awesome training of our staff and very</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.340" end="00:27:42.940" style="s2">clear expectations around what centered</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.410" end="00:27:44.830" style="s2">and how we calculate things I&#39;m alike</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.940" end="00:27:45.940" style="s2">but we&#39;re certainly that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.830" end="00:27:48.010" style="s2">one<span style="s3"> of</span> those things that&#39;s probably an</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.940" end="00:27:49.990" style="s2">ongoing issue I can&#39;t imagine a day when</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.010" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2"><span style="s3">you</span> know sensitive<span style="s3"> information</span> like that</p>
