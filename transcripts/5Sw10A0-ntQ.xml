<p begin="00:37:17.220" end="00:37:21.030" style="s2"><span style="s3">don&#39;t</span> think there&#39;s a public campaign</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.020" end="00:37:22.050" style="s2">around those judges right now but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.030" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2"><span style="s4">think</span> part<span style="s3"> of</span> what you&#39;re saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.050" end="00:37:25.950" style="s2">judges are afraid of letting someone out</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:28.020" style="s2">and<span style="s3"> something</span> bad happening but we need</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.950" end="00:37:29.640" style="s2">to make judges feel accountable for</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.020" end="00:37:31.470" style="s2">keeping people in cages unnecessarily</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.640" end="00:37:33.180" style="s2">because that&#39;s<span style="s3"> also</span> a bad outcome that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.470" end="00:37:34.830" style="s2">judges can be responsible<span style="s4"> for</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.180" end="00:37:38.460" style="s2">problem is judicial elections are not</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.830" end="00:37:40.940" style="s2">very widely watched and it&#39;s it was the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.460" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2"><span style="s4">early</span> 90s the last time a judge was</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.940" end="00:37:45.150" style="s2">voted out and that was<span style="s3"> because</span> the<span style="s3"> FOP</span></p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:47.130" style="s2">organized the Fraternal Order of Police</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.150" end="00:37:48.990" style="s2">organized against that edge so you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.130" end="00:37:52.680" style="s2">get<span style="s3"> a</span> sense of where they were coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.990" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">from work and how well funded campaign</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.680" end="00:37:57.510" style="s2">was so I<span style="s3"> definitely</span> think that judicial</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:38:00.060" style="s2">accountability is a very real thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.510" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">we mean and there are people talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.060" end="00:38:05.700" style="s2">about what that looks like whether</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:08.580" style="s2">that&#39;s more internal to the judiciary or</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.700" end="00:38:10.830" style="s2">whether it is sort of public campaign</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.580" end="00:38:13.320" style="s2">led by community groups wherever<span style="s3"> would</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:10.830" end="00:38:15.120" style="s2">be around specific judges and<span style="s3"> their</span></p>

<p begin="00:38:19.260" end="00:38:22.940" style="s2"><span style="s3">I don&#39;t think was developed here I think</span></p>
<p begin="00:38:21.210" end="00:38:27.330" style="s2">it was<span style="s3"> developed</span><span style="s4"> as</span> part of a free geek</p>
