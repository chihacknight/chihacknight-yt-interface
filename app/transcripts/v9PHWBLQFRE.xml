<p begin="00:00:40.430" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">data open by default and the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">interesting part about it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:51.239" style="s2">when when something like this comes</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.229" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">well wait a<span style="s3"> minute</span> who is the audience</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">and how are they going to use this data</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:24.299" style="s2"><span style="s3">you</span> look at the orders<span style="s3"> I</span> I don&#39;t know it</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.299" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">need<span style="s4"> to</span> make it<span style="s3"> available</span> so okay well</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:33.450" style="s2">we have tons of data we have we have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:38.009" style="s2">program data we have sponsored research</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.450" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">we we have various surveys how do I<span style="s3"> know</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:38.009" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2">when I&#39;m done it&#39;s like well<span style="s4"> it</span> says</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.060" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">available<span style="s3"> okay</span> we&#39;ll get right on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.470" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">now what about personally identifiable</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">information or risk of<span style="s4"> RIA denta</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">fication that&#39;s hard<span style="s3"> to</span> do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:02:00.869" style="s2">expensive what&#39;s my budget oh yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">the budget there is no budget this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.869" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">just a mandate so fast forward<span style="s3"> three</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:15.590" style="s2">years<span style="s4"> it gets 2016 now we have to</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:19.640" style="s2">a thousand<span style="s3"> data sets at the federal</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:15.590" end="00:02:23.860" style="s2">level at data gov which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.640" end="00:02:28.010" style="s2">really<span style="s3"> impressive</span> given what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.860" end="00:02:29.780" style="s2">constraints the data owners are under</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.010" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">and the fact that this<span style="s4"> is</span> not even<span style="s3"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:29.780" end="00:02:37.420" style="s2">primary job so my big tip of<span style="s3"> the hat to</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:41.060" style="s2">them for<span style="s3"> doing</span> such a such a great job</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.420" end="00:02:45.530" style="s2">however there&#39;s a problem there<span style="s3"> are</span> no</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.060" end="00:02:49.970" style="s2">provisions in this order for measurement</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.530" end="00:02:52.610" style="s2"><span style="s3">of</span> value and what happens when you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.970" end="00:02:58.250" style="s2">no measure<span style="s3"> of</span> value even</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.610" end="00:02:59.810" style="s2">well-intentioned data owners what do</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.250" end="00:03:02.780" style="s2"><span style="s3">they</span> do they<span style="s3"> have</span> an<span style="s4"> incentive</span> to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.810" end="00:03:05.450" style="s2">release what is easiest and what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.780" end="00:03:09.650" style="s2">least risky so you have a proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.450" end="00:03:13.160" style="s2">of<span style="s3"> data sets a lot of</span> them pretty low</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.650" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">value and<span style="s3"> that</span> makes it harder<span style="s3"> even</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:13.160" end="00:03:18.670" style="s2">harder to find the the one that you need</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.540" end="00:03:25.190" style="s2">so this is<span style="s4"> a</span> good<span style="s3"> time</span> to take a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.160" end="00:03:26.750" style="s2">bit of a step back tell you what<span style="s3"> this</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:25.190" end="00:03:29.590" style="s2">thing is about so<span style="s3"> I&#39;m</span> going<span style="s3"> to</span> tell<span style="s4"> you</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:26.750" end="00:03:33.410" style="s2">about a<span style="s3"> program</span> that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.590" end="00:03:35.390" style="s2">demand-driven open data or Dee do Dee it</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.410" end="00:03:36.920" style="s2">is the government&#39;s I was told it needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.390" end="00:03:43.600" style="s2">a convoluted acronym so there you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.920" end="00:03:49.010" style="s2">it this program was launched in 2014 as</p>

<p begin="00:04:07.180" end="00:04:12.739" style="s2">so the<span style="s3"> concept</span> of lean data and applying</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.280" end="00:04:17.150" style="s2">lean data to open data seemed very</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.739" end="00:04:19.989" style="s2">natural to me there are three<span style="s3"> components</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:17.150" end="00:04:23.539" style="s2">to that there is first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.989" end="00:04:25.940" style="s2">understand the customer and in the</p>

<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:47.229" style="s2">finally measurement is super critical</p>
