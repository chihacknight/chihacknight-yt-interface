<p begin="00:00:10.950" end="00:00:17.310" style="s2">um here<span style="s3"> we</span> go<span style="s4"> all right so if you build</span></p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:20.220" style="s2">it will they come I&#39;m titling my</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.310" end="00:00:21.570" style="s2">talkback and also you know thinking</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.220" end="00:00:23.699" style="s2"><span style="s3">about</span> how human centered design</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.570" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">principles can direct our products I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.699" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">just a little<span style="s3"> bit</span> about me I got my</p>

<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:33.870" style="s2">development and<span style="s4"> also</span> visual arts and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.990" end="00:00:36.270" style="s2">since then i also got<span style="s4"> i</span> moved here from</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.870" end="00:00:37.860" style="s2">sunny California to<span style="s3"> Chicago</span> although</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.270" end="00:00:41.840" style="s2">outside right now it seems pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.860" end="00:00:44.520" style="s2">logical for me too<span style="s4"> I&#39;ve</span> done that but I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.840" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2"><span style="s4">through</span> my Master&#39;s research I also</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.520" end="00:00:49.860" style="s2">researched um human centered design and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:52.890" style="s2">how they affect organizations from</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.860" end="00:00:55.920" style="s2">nonprofits to hybrid organizations to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.890" end="00:00:58.260" style="s2">leave in major corporations so there has</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.920" end="00:01:00.059" style="s2">been a huge sort<span style="s4"> of</span> like slew of</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.260" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">journeys that i&#39;ve also been on since</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.059" end="00:01:04.979" style="s2">studying those things applying them to</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">my day-to-day job and for actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.979" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">getting paid to do this as<span style="s3"> well</span> so<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">like you you run into those situations</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">and<span style="s4"> i&#39;d</span> like<span style="s3"> to</span><span style="s4"> kind</span><span style="s3"> of</span> like bring some</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:17.820" style="s2">of those thoughts here and like Derek ad</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">said we live in a build first world</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.820" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">right like everyone&#39;s always really</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">ready<span style="s3"> to</span> put<span style="s4"> something</span> out there see how</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:27.960" style="s2"><span style="s4">it</span> reacts and you know but the question</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2"><span style="s3">really</span> is are we building for human</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.960" end="00:01:32.610" style="s2">needs right a lot of times we think</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:35.850" style="s2">about these ideas and we put them<span style="s4"> out</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:32.610" end="00:01:39.000" style="s2">there and then afterwards we say oh I</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.850" end="00:01:41.070" style="s2">guess that was the wrong idea<span style="s4"> and</span> then</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.000" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">we<span style="s3"> learned</span> to take<span style="s3"> it</span> step<span style="s3"> backwards</span> and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.070" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">I&#39;m actually really happy to hear all</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:48.119" style="s2">the<span style="s4"> UX</span> designers in here and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">researchers and everybody in here<span style="s4"> even</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:48.119" end="00:01:52.829" style="s2">if you know the engineers that existing</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">here I&#39;m sure by now you&#39;ve heard of UX</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.829" end="00:01:58.320" style="s2">and either they pestered you about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">something already but this is where</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.320" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">we&#39;re going<span style="s4"> right</span> i<span style="s4"> think</span> five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2"><span style="s3">and</span> if i would have<span style="s4"> have</span> asked anybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:07.560" style="s2">in this room who</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.680" end="00:02:09.479" style="s2">I do it would have still been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.560" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">like a oh yeah I&#39;ve heard about<span style="s4"> them</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:09.479" end="00:02:14.580" style="s2">they kind of do some<span style="s4"> like</span> innovation</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:17.070" style="s2">research human centered design but they</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.580" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">are kind of ambassadors to make this</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.070" end="00:02:24.510" style="s2">idea sort of labeled first of<span style="s3"> all</span> and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:28.470" style="s2">marketed towards people to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.510" end="00:02:30.660" style="s2">digest it in a feasible manner on human</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.470" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">centered design is really<span style="s3"> just</span> problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.660" end="00:02:35.910" style="s2">solving right and where<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">solving for people and finding those</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.910" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">problems initially this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">chaotic sort of journey and methodology</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:48.570" style="s2">but theoretically this<span style="s4"> is</span> what happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:51.150" style="s2">right you find your problem research in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.570" end="00:02:54.060" style="s2">your data collection you organize data</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.150" end="00:02:56.489" style="s2">and find things<span style="s4"> to transform foods into</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:54.060" end="00:02:59.510" style="s2">insights transforming insights into</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.489" end="00:03:02.910" style="s2">design opportunities brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.510" end="00:03:05.580" style="s2">designing prototyping and experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.910" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">and then finally delivering right but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.580" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t<span style="s3"> necessarily</span> even stop very kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:14.340" style="s2">of cycles on and on and on as humans as</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">we change as well even from last year</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.340" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">the condition that we were in as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:20.820" style="s2">to this year things<span style="s4"> are</span> very different</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:23.489" style="s2">right even in our environment even<span style="s3"> in</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:20.820" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">the past week<span style="s3"> or</span> weather is so weird you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.489" end="00:03:29.580" style="s2">know like how do we just do those things</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:31.590" style="s2">so this<span style="s3"> is</span> an image<span style="s4"> of</span> probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.580" end="00:03:35.100" style="s2">something that<span style="s4"> you</span> see online all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.590" end="00:03:37.140" style="s2">time when people<span style="s4"> bring</span> in this<span style="s4"> idea</span> of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.100" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">human centered design is what a<span style="s3"> post-its</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:37.140" end="00:03:41.100" style="s2">and<span style="s4"> it&#39;s always like oh my</span><span style="s3"> god</span> why are</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:43.230" style="s2">they so fluorescent and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.100" end="00:03:46.769" style="s2"><span style="s4">like</span> staring at me<span style="s3"> all</span> the time you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.230" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t mean too nervous right I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.769" end="00:03:52.140" style="s2">know<span style="s4"> for</span><span style="s3"> sure</span> in even in<span style="s4"> our</span> office you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:54.269" style="s2">know engineers<span style="s4"> have</span> come up to<span style="s3"> our</span> team</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.140" end="00:03:57.390" style="s2">and<span style="s4"> been</span> like why do you guys have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.269" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2"><span style="s4">put</span> that up there all the time right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.390" end="00:04:01.700" style="s2">it&#39;s<span style="s4"> just actually like a really</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:04.260" style="s2">fascinating journey for us in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">organization as well but I did want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.260" end="00:04:08.310" style="s2">kind of<span style="s4"> actually</span> call out this idea of a</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.310" end="00:04:14.280" style="s2">in terms of paper but every single<span style="s4"> one</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:11.459" end="00:04:14.780" style="s2">of these posters have a data piece of a</p>

<p begin="00:04:40.280" end="00:04:45.290" style="s2">of a way where we condition ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.130" end="00:04:48.740" style="s2">not necessarily just stuff all of our</p>

<p begin="00:04:48.740" end="00:04:54.200" style="s2">you know computer things but literally</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.620" end="00:04:57.050" style="s2">put them on the wall and say this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.200" end="00:04:59.870" style="s2">what the human said and as we cluster</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.050" end="00:05:02.390" style="s2">things together how are we receiving</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.870" end="00:05:04.940" style="s2">these things to have more of<span style="s4"> an</span> impact</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.390" end="00:05:08.600" style="s2">not<span style="s4"> only</span> on us but how do we see</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.940" end="00:05:11.180" style="s2">patterns in that behavior as well<span style="s4"> um</span> I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.600" end="00:05:14.150" style="s2">wanted<span style="s4"> to</span> bring<span style="s4"> this</span> slide up for humans</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.820" end="00:05:40.460" style="s2">couple of weeks we&#39;re I&#39;ve been training</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.510" end="00:07:22.550" style="s2">they were really<span style="s4"> curious</span> how people use</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.430" end="00:07:25.730" style="s2">calendars and we approach somebody in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.550" end="00:07:28.820" style="s2">the cafe and the beautiful just sort<span style="s4"> of</span></p>

<p begin="00:07:31.130" end="00:07:37.460" style="s2">like and how he kept his calendar which</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.100" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">is currently<span style="s4"> on</span> a whiteboard<span style="s3"> talk</span> about</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.460" end="00:07:41.930" style="s2">this beautiful story right where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:44.660" style="s2">assuming from the client<span style="s4"> side</span> that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.930" end="00:07:46.820" style="s2">everybody uses digital calendars and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.660" end="00:07:49.340" style="s2">walk into this space and he tells us I</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.820" end="00:07:52.340" style="s2">don&#39;t use that<span style="s4"> at</span> all I use a whiteboard</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.340" end="00:07:53.990" style="s2">and this is what it<span style="s4"> looks</span> like and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.340" end="00:07:56.360" style="s2">come back and we think about<span style="s4"> these</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:53.990" end="00:07:58.520" style="s2">things and these ideas that we had</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.360" end="00:08:00.730" style="s2">originally<span style="s4"> and</span> it&#39;s just totally thrown</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.520" end="00:08:04.190" style="s2">out the window and it&#39;s a really<span style="s4"> good</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:00.730" end="00:08:06.620" style="s2"><span style="s4">way</span> for us to not only connect with our</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.190" end="00:08:08.930" style="s2"><span style="s3">community</span> but<span style="s4"> to</span> really understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.620" end="00:08:12.620" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening and when we</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:15.350" style="s2">are just around so many texts people as</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.620" end="00:08:18.260" style="s2">well we sort of use the same things in</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.350" end="00:08:21.560" style="s2">the same way so learning more about</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.260" end="00:08:23.150" style="s2"><span style="s4">people</span> in that general fashion is just</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.560" end="00:08:26.900" style="s2">super important and<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span><span style="s3"> actually</span> just</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.150" end="00:08:29.000" style="s2">really fun so thanks to consider right</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.900" end="00:08:31.430" style="s2">this is a really broad topic and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.000" end="00:08:33.770" style="s2">no way that<span style="s3"> I&#39;m</span> going<span style="s4"> to</span> actually walk</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.430" end="00:08:36.110" style="s2">through from beginning to end whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.770" end="00:08:38.520" style="s2">you<span style="s4"> like human centered</span> concept<span style="s4"> can</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:36.110" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">contribute to<span style="s3"> what</span> you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.520" end="00:08:43.540" style="s2">but I do have a few<span style="s3"> things</span> that I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:45.670" style="s2"><span style="s3">to</span> go<span style="s3"> through</span> as maybe takeaways from</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.540" end="00:08:47.350" style="s2">this especially when we&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.670" end="00:08:49.030" style="s2">the digital sphere and I have a few</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.350" end="00:08:51.700" style="s2">examples<span style="s3"> at</span> the end and I will<span style="s3"> kind of</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:49.030" end="00:08:54.870" style="s2">like try this if you but one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.700" end="00:08:59.230" style="s2"><span style="s4">use paper right I</span><span style="s3"> know that we are all</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:54.870" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">focused in on our<span style="s4"> laptops</span> in the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.230" end="00:09:03.400" style="s2">that<span style="s3"> we</span> can efficiently<span style="s4"> open</span><span style="s3"> source</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">things but actually when you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.400" end="00:09:09.220" style="s2">about your product paper is an evil by</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:12.190" style="s2">the way you can recycle it too there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.220" end="00:09:14.980" style="s2">component<span style="s4"> that</span> happens where something</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.190" end="00:09:16.900" style="s2">physical shows up in your hand and<span style="s4"> you</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:14.980" end="00:09:20.830" style="s2">begin to understand it in a very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.900" end="00:09:24.250" style="s2">different<span style="s3"> way</span> so if anything<span style="s3"> just</span> get</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.830" end="00:09:25.990" style="s2">your hands on to a sketch right raise</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.250" end="00:09:32.440" style="s2">your hand if you think you<span style="s4"> cannot</span> sketch</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.990" end="00:09:34.870" style="s2">I promise you you can like I i I&#39;ve I</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.440" end="00:09:36.670" style="s2">promise you just put your pen onto a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.870" end="00:09:40.510" style="s2">paper and<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> magical things will</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.670" end="00:09:42.820" style="s2">happen<span style="s4"> and</span> be brave all right um there</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.510" end="00:09:44.950" style="s2">is this question in research that I run</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.820" end="00:09:47.560" style="s2">into all the time right we think<span style="s3"> about</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:44.950" end="00:09:48.970" style="s2">research as in like I will just go<span style="s4"> ask</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.560" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">bunch of people<span style="s3"> a</span> bunch of questions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.970" end="00:09:52.690" style="s2"><span style="s4">then</span> whatever<span style="s4"> we</span> ask them those will</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:56.260" style="s2">drive our product needs and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.690" end="00:09:59.140" style="s2">statistics um let&#39;s decipher that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.260" end="00:10:02.170" style="s2">that&#39;s a great idea you know does</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.140" end="00:10:04.570" style="s2"><span style="s4">anybody of you have like a side app idea</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:02.170" end="00:10:07.810" style="s2">that you kind of talk to people about no</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.570" end="00:10:09.460" style="s2">I do and I those things come into in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.810" end="00:10:12.010" style="s2">mind all the time and when you talk to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.460" end="00:10:13.660" style="s2">somebody which is usually your friend or</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.010" end="00:10:15.280" style="s2">family member right they&#39;re<span style="s4"> gonna</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:13.660" end="00:10:19.270" style="s2">they&#39;re going to say yeah that&#39;s<span style="s4"> great</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:15.280" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">you should<span style="s3"> build</span> it right um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.270" end="00:10:24.130" style="s2">this moment when you<span style="s4"> ask</span> research</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:26.550" style="s2">questions and a lot of times you ask</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.130" end="00:10:29.350" style="s2">them and freeze them in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.550" end="00:10:31.740" style="s2">would you want something like this<span style="s4"> you</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:29.350" end="00:10:35.730" style="s2">know tell<span style="s3"> me</span> tell me about<span style="s4"> what</span> you<span style="s4"> want</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:31.740" end="00:10:39.010" style="s2">tell<span style="s3"> me</span><span style="s4"> about</span> you know this idea of want</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.730" end="00:10:40.810" style="s2">versus tell me more right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.010" end="00:10:45.370" style="s2">shift that should happen in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.810" end="00:10:47.530" style="s2">phrasing and as you really asking to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.370" end="00:10:49.450" style="s2">Smith questions digging in deeper<span style="s4"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:47.530" end="00:10:50.060" style="s2">always asking tell me a little bit more</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.470" end="00:11:10.670" style="s2">and at the same time really digging into</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:13.700" style="s2">those ideas um visceral reactions are</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.670" end="00:11:16.370" style="s2">crucial and I know that designers<span style="s4"> get</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:13.700" end="00:11:18.890" style="s2">sometimes like a bad rep about about oh</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.750" end="00:18:45.410" style="s2">um thinking about our data that&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.020" end="00:18:47.870" style="s2">there right this robot here protects all</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.080" end="00:20:43.820" style="s2"><span style="s3">get</span> their hands on them and the<span style="s3"> more</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:41.390" end="00:20:45.799" style="s2">they may searched into why these infants</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.820" end="00:20:48.350" style="s2">were passing away it was the<span style="s4"> fact</span> that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.799" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">they were<span style="s3"> just</span> too<span style="s4"> cold</span> right the more</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.350" end="00:20:52.669" style="s2">and more that they begin to hear all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:55.640" style="s2"><span style="s3">mothers and nurses and doctors talk</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:52.669" end="00:20:57.890" style="s2">about it they realize<span style="s3"> that</span> these babies</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.640" end="00:20:59.990" style="s2">are just too cold<span style="s4"> and</span> so this little</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.890" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">efforts of creating a small prototype</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.990" end="00:21:04.760" style="s2">and this is kind<span style="s4"> of</span> like version<span style="s3"> three</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:09.140" style="s2">already<span style="s4"> but</span> creating a small little</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.760" end="00:21:11.679" style="s2">sleeping bag for the<span style="s4"> babies</span> that were</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.140" end="00:21:15.140" style="s2">also<span style="s4"> sourced</span> from materials around them</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.679" end="00:21:17.360" style="s2">this is now saving like hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.140" end="00:21:20.330" style="s2">babies every day just<span style="s4"> by</span> keeping them</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.360" end="00:21:23.409" style="s2">warm and it&#39;s like this idea of coming</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.330" end="00:21:26.330" style="s2">into a situation as well to think about</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.409" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">what things can I help with how can I</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.330" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">emphasize so there&#39;s my easy</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.100" end="00:21:47.270" style="s2">so what we&#39;ll just you<span style="s4"> and</span><span style="s3"> we&#39;ll</span><span style="s4"> just</span> QA</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.630" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">and we&#39;ll run this microphone around so</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.270" end="00:21:51.390" style="s2">go ahead<span style="s4"> and</span> put your<span style="s4"> hands</span> up you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:53.220" style="s2">do you want to you can run take whoever</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.390" end="00:21:54.899" style="s2">you want to answer the questions and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.220" end="00:22:04.860" style="s2">then Christopher you can run around Mike</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.899" end="00:22:07.770" style="s2">so here<span style="s4"> we</span> go hi so a quick question for</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.860" end="00:22:09.059" style="s2">you<span style="s4"> how</span><span style="s3"> do</span> you I think human centered</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.770" end="00:22:11.250" style="s2">design is a really cool idea for</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.059" end="00:22:13.470" style="s2">building new products but<span style="s4"> what</span> do<span style="s4"> you</span> do</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.250" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">if you feel like you have kind<span style="s3"> of</span> a half</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.470" end="00:22:18.179" style="s2">baked product or a half-baked idea and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">you want to see and<span style="s3"> you</span> want to shave it</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.179" end="00:22:21.870" style="s2">towards human centered design so how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:24.899" style="s2">you apply<span style="s4"> it</span> to something that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.870" end="00:22:26.940" style="s2">been partially built sure and we run</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.899" end="00:22:28.830" style="s2">into that situation a lot actually at</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.940" end="00:22:31.740" style="s2">does mine where people will bring their</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.830" end="00:22:34.980" style="s2">version 1.0 product and try to figure</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.740" end="00:22:36.990" style="s2"><span style="s4">out</span> how they<span style="s3"> can</span> improve it definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.980" end="00:22:40.500" style="s2">heuristic analysis of trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.990" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">out the<span style="s4"> 10</span> points in which a product can</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.500" end="00:22:44.309" style="s2">be determined to be<span style="s3"> closed</span> closely</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2"><span style="s3">related to England</span><span style="s4"> is ready to</span> deliver</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.309" end="00:22:49.789" style="s2">they know that you&#39;re sick analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:54.049" style="s2">process and there are ten ten principles</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.789" end="00:22:57.450" style="s2">that you can look for<span style="s4"> based</span> on<span style="s3"> Nielsen&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="00:22:54.049" end="00:22:59.880" style="s2">principles and there are ways to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.450" end="00:23:02.990" style="s2">determine and measure<span style="s3"> how</span> closely you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.880" end="00:23:05.250" style="s2">are relating your product to<span style="s4"> people</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:02.990" end="00:23:08.850" style="s2">definitely that that&#39;s a very<span style="s3"> scientific</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:05.250" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">research approach about it putting it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.850" end="00:23:14.039" style="s2">front<span style="s4"> of</span> humans and testing in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">usability manner oh absolutely that but</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.039" end="00:23:17.700" style="s2">you know<span style="s4"> I</span> think<span style="s4"> that</span> that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:23.370" style="s2">really important there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.700" end="00:23:25.830" style="s2">that even<span style="s4"> in</span> a small idea all right that</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.370" end="00:23:28.169" style="s2">we can assume and just seeing<span style="s4"> people</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:25.830" end="00:23:29.669" style="s2">operate in that<span style="s4"> space</span> just without<span style="s4"> even</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:28.169" end="00:23:32.100" style="s2">telling them what they should be looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.669" end="00:23:38.909" style="s2"><span style="s4">for</span> is a really great learning</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.100" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">experience and<span style="s3"> um</span> what else I think<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:38.909" end="00:23:42.299" style="s2"><span style="s4">Fred</span> I would definitely start with that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">the heuristic analysis<span style="s3"> is</span> actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.299" end="00:23:48.990" style="s2">really powerful<span style="s3"> thing</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:51.120" style="s2">if you if you know about<span style="s4"> it</span> we can I can</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.990" end="00:23:53.640" style="s2">pull up<span style="s4"> the</span><span style="s3"> 10</span><span style="s4"> principles</span> but we</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.120" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">actually did a heuristic analysis for a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.640" end="00:23:58.830" style="s2">client recently and determined all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:01.710" style="s2">the different ways why their products</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.830" end="00:24:04.650" style="s2">was honestly wrong and<span style="s3"> just</span> like just</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.710" end="00:24:08.430" style="s2"><span style="s4">built</span> in correctly not necessarily that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.650" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">like the idea I mean the idea in some</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.430" end="00:24:17.550" style="s2">ways was still wrong but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:20.340" style="s2">actually a really good sort of<span style="s4"> like</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:17.550" end="00:24:23.430" style="s2">doctors note like are you like you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.340" end="00:24:25.470" style="s2">a headache you have the<span style="s3"> sinful</span> you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.430" end="00:24:27.000" style="s2">like those kinds of principles that<span style="s4"> you</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:25.470" end="00:24:32.270" style="s2">can measure your product<span style="s4"> and</span> I would</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.000" end="00:24:32.270" style="s2">encourage you<span style="s3"> to</span> do<span style="s3"> that</span> other questions</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.020" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">how do<span style="s3"> you</span> know when you&#39;ve interacted</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.310" end="00:24:53.040" style="s2">with enough humans and for beep boop and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:55.080" style="s2">and for what projects and problems do</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.040" end="00:24:58.020" style="s2">you need<span style="s4"> to talk to more people and for</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:55.080" end="00:25:00.810" style="s2">what do you<span style="s3"> need</span> fewer opinions on that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.020" end="00:25:03.150" style="s2">is the hardest question than I even have</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.810" end="00:25:05.640" style="s2">to<span style="s3"> answer</span> all the time honestly like we</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.150" end="00:25:08.000" style="s2">think<span style="s4"> about</span> these pilots and micro pilot</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.820" end="00:26:35.550" style="s2">about what are like common pitfalls or</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.830" end="00:26:37.500" style="s2">maybe early warning signs when you hear</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.550" end="00:26:39.090" style="s2">a certain like really<span style="s3"> the</span> clients were</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.500" end="00:26:40.740" style="s2">saying that they want to do X Y or Z</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.090" end="00:26:42.270" style="s2">that<span style="s4"> you</span> know that they&#39;re going down</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.740" end="00:26:44.190" style="s2">kind<span style="s4"> of</span> like a wrong path if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.270" end="00:26:45.780" style="s2">some like early warning signs<span style="s4"> that</span> you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.190" end="00:26:48.750" style="s2">could<span style="s4"> think</span> of that would be generally</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.780" end="00:26:52.140" style="s2">useful for folks yeah um when you hear</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.750" end="00:26:55.170" style="s2"><span style="s3">people</span> talk about their stakeholders all</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.140" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">the time that&#39;s a huge red flag right</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.170" end="00:27:00.030" style="s2">like because when they&#39;re<span style="s3"> talking</span> about</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:03.900" style="s2">like their box that says this needs to</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.030" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">happen that that&#39;s a really big like</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.900" end="00:27:09.500" style="s2">moment where you need to say okay<span style="s4"> let&#39;s</span></p>

<p begin="00:27:12.840" end="00:27:17.730" style="s2">harsh but it is really<span style="s3"> a</span><span style="s4"> huge</span> red flag</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.570" end="00:27:22.260" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> we run into all the<span style="s4"> time</span> where</p>

<p begin="00:27:22.260" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">about a product to certain<span style="s4"> Lane</span> they</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.090" end="00:27:30.570" style="s2">want us to<span style="s3"> execute</span> a certain piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:32.670" style="s2">we recently<span style="s4"> went</span><span style="s3"> into</span> a situation where</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.570" end="00:27:34.260" style="s2">yeah the boss then entered the room<span style="s3"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:32.670" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">he was like this isn&#39;t what I want you</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.090" end="00:27:47.370" style="s2">your client team and but take a step</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.000" end="00:27:48.900" style="s2">back<span style="s4"> analyze</span> what&#39;s actually the</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.900" end="00:27:52.470" style="s2">actually even more important for</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.070" end="00:27:55.770" style="s2"><span style="s4">nonprofit</span> structures<span style="s4"> too</span> because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.470" end="00:27:58.680" style="s2">hierarchy is so strong but to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.770" end="00:28:00.220" style="s2">Democratic peace as strongly as you<span style="s4"> can</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:58.680" end="00:28:03.280" style="s2">to bring people<span style="s3"> in</span><span style="s4"> the</span> same room at</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.280" end="00:28:08.940" style="s2">usually<span style="s3"> the</span> biggest red flag that<span style="s3"> i</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:04.809" end="00:28:12.549" style="s2"><span style="s4">present</span> to other red flags<span style="s4"> hugo</span> is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.940" end="00:28:14.590" style="s2">designers who then just kind of mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.549" end="00:28:17.830" style="s2">it&#39;s really<span style="s4"> easy</span> to like fall in love</p>

<p begin="00:28:20.370" end="00:28:25.929" style="s2">but if you do hear a designer as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.260" end="00:28:29.770" style="s2">just talk about like oh but it would<span style="s3"> be</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:25.929" end="00:28:32.110" style="s2"><span style="s3">so</span> cool right<span style="s4"> like</span> there&#39;s<span style="s3"> nothing</span> cool</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.049" end="00:28:40.929" style="s2">of it also when engineers come in and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.409" end="00:28:43.690" style="s2">they&#39;re like that<span style="s4"> well</span> that can&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.929" end="00:28:47.650" style="s2"><span style="s4">and</span> they just like can&#39;t explain that<span style="s4"> to</span></p>

<p begin="00:28:49.780" end="00:28:54.760" style="s2">anxiety piece that comes into that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.330" end="00:28:56.350" style="s2">conversation I&#39;m just kind of taking a</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.760" end="00:28:57.880" style="s2">step back and<span style="s3"> be</span> like<span style="s4"> okay</span> well can<span style="s4"> you</span></p>

<p begin="00:29:42.070" end="00:29:48.070" style="s2">but very different products that people</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">may be reluctant to adopt right away and</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.070" end="00:29:55.179" style="s2">and because the technology is advanced</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.020" end="00:30:19.700" style="s2">because I I was speaking to some service</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.900" end="00:30:52.429" style="s2">obviously psychology majors in here that</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.840" end="00:30:55.970" style="s2">say there are so many things wrong with</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:50.140" style="s2">that anybody sort of argued with that in</p>
