<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">investigations we&#39;ve gained some</p>

<p begin="00:02:17.010" end="00:02:23.490" style="s2"><span style="s4">question</span> do whatever<span style="s3"> you</span> need so we can</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.490" end="00:02:27.420" style="s2">simpler for simplest form is something</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:29.880" style="s2">that you<span style="s4"> can</span> all relate to its data sets</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:31.620" style="s2">would you call it data sets we sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.880" end="00:02:33.960" style="s2">call it<span style="s3"> data</span> sets but<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span> evidence it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:42.930" style="s2">think of<span style="s4"> that</span> can help us identify the</p>

<p begin="00:03:03.380" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">cognizant way so everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.370" end="00:03:10.980" style="s2">understand exactly what we did and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:12.500" style="s2">like I said we&#39;ve unfortunately gained</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.980" end="00:03:14.459" style="s2">some handcuffs as a result of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.500" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">transitioning from a government<span style="s3"> agency</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:14.459" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">to<span style="s4"> the</span> private sector and lost some</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:22.049" style="s2">handcuffs and so let me give you some</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:23.820" style="s2">examples of<span style="s3"> that</span> and a legislative</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.049" end="00:03:26.519" style="s2">inspector general I had the authority of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.820" end="00:03:28.470" style="s2">a municipal agency behind me so when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.519" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">called people<span style="s3"> would</span> listen they would do</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.470" end="00:03:32.760" style="s2">as I asked I would be<span style="s4"> able</span><span style="s3"> to</span> get people</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.760" end="00:03:36.930" style="s2">them to come talk to me so there was an</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.100" end="00:03:39.600" style="s2">air that we carried that we<span style="s3"> simply</span> no</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.930" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">longer have the other tool that we had</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.600" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">was obviously access to databases that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:46.190" style="s2"><span style="s4">we</span> don&#39;t<span style="s3"> have</span><span style="s4"> any</span> more government</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.670" end="00:03:54.420" style="s2">country to be able<span style="s3"> to secure various</span></p>

<p begin="00:04:10.890" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">get that anymore but the biggest tool</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.320" end="00:04:17.790" style="s2">that I<span style="s3"> lost</span> was subpoena power and all</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:19.200" style="s2">of you know what subpoena subpoena is I</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.790" end="00:04:21.510" style="s2">don&#39;t<span style="s4"> need</span><span style="s3"> to go into the</span> details of</p>

<p begin="00:04:21.510" end="00:04:26.070" style="s2">important because in my job most</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:27.340" style="s2">investigations are historical so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.070" end="00:04:29.169" style="s2">not like there&#39;s an ongoing</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.410" end="00:12:26.580" style="s2">bit<span style="s3"> and</span> so we decided<span style="s3"> to</span> resurrect it</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.750" end="00:12:28.980" style="s2">because we felt that campaign finance is</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.580" end="00:12:31.290" style="s2">very important as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.980" end="00:12:34.550" style="s2">seen in the news and<span style="s3"> on</span> a state level on</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.290" end="00:12:36.540" style="s2">a federal level and and other places so</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.550" end="00:12:38.940" style="s2">we started with the state board of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.540" end="00:12:41.220" style="s2">elections website and we took the data</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.940" end="00:12:43.290" style="s2">that was on that website and we noted</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.220" end="00:12:45.510" style="s2">immediately the easy ways that people</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.290" end="00:12:46.980" style="s2">cheat they misspelled names they use</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.510" end="00:12:49.050" style="s2">different addresses even though<span style="s3"> they&#39;re</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:46.980" end="00:12:51.270" style="s2">same person they<span style="s4"> changed</span> their company</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.050" end="00:12:52.800" style="s2">names they change spouses names so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.270" end="00:12:54.210" style="s2">first thing we noticed was<span style="s3"> the</span> weakness</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.800" end="00:12:56.430" style="s2">in the site that we weren&#39;t<span style="s3"> able</span> to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.210" end="00:12:58.740" style="s2"><span style="s3">manipulate</span> that data to see how<span style="s4"> we</span> could</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.430" end="00:13:00.990" style="s2">use<span style="s4"> it</span> best to identify the problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.740" end="00:13:03.060" style="s2">that we thought we regard to see so my</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.990" end="00:13:04.470" style="s2">team first pulled off all that data off</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.060" end="00:13:06.810" style="s2"><span style="s4">the</span> website<span style="s3"> and</span> put<span style="s3"> it</span> into<span style="s3"> our</span> own</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.470" end="00:13:09.870" style="s2">spreadsheet and started manipulating the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.810" end="00:13:11.700" style="s2">data there to sort it to see whose whose</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.870" end="00:13:14.340" style="s2">clothes and names who&#39;s close in age</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.700" end="00:13:17.280" style="s2">whose clothes in addresses to identify</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.340" end="00:13:19.650" style="s2">any common patterns we could so the<span style="s3"> next</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:17.280" end="00:13:22.110" style="s2">step after that is obviously we then</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.650" end="00:13:22.440" style="s2">have to now identify the<span style="s3"> people</span> and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.110" end="00:13:23.790" style="s2">comp</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.440" end="00:13:25.860" style="s2"><span style="s3">is</span> donating to these<span style="s4"> particular</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:23.790" end="00:13:27.930" style="s2">individuals and so we had to go to</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.860" end="00:13:30.270" style="s2">portal after portal and if any of you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.930" end="00:13:32.010" style="s2">have been<span style="s4"> to</span> City portals before you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.270" end="00:13:35.310" style="s2">see that the city&#39;s portals are</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.010" end="00:13:37.380" style="s2">incredibly scattered and fragmented what</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.310" end="00:13:38.730" style="s2">the parks department has on their portal</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.380" end="00:13:40.590" style="s2">is completely different<span style="s4"> to</span><span style="s3"> what</span> the city</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.730" end="00:13:42.420" style="s2">of<span style="s4"> Chicago</span> has on their portal for</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.590" end="00:13:44.130" style="s2">instance vendor payments are available</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.420" end="00:13:45.300" style="s2">in the parks department&#39;s portal but</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.130" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">they&#39;re not available<span style="s4"> in</span> the city of</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.620" end="00:13:51.060" style="s2">sister agencies it&#39;s one big city</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.410" end="00:13:53.460" style="s2">there&#39;s no aggregation of this data so</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.060" end="00:13:55.650" style="s2">we went to<span style="s3"> looking</span> at the<span style="s3"> contracts</span> list</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.460" end="00:13:57.510" style="s2">on one place vendors listed in another</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.510" end="00:14:03.030" style="s2">and it goes on<span style="s3"> and</span> on and<span style="s4"> on</span> and so my</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.310" end="00:14:14.460" style="s2">spreadsheet aggravated so we could</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.040" end="00:14:25.590" style="s2">that that simply was unnecessary if</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.920" end="00:14:27.960" style="s2">we&#39;re seeking open and open government</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.590" end="00:14:43.380" style="s2">and they said they simply couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.940" end="00:14:45.510" style="s2">duplicate it because it would take them</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.380" end="00:14:47.430" style="s2">too long because there&#39;s no resource</p>
