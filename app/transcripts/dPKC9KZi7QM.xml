<p begin="00:02:51.090" end="00:02:55.319" style="s2">actually<span style="s3"> took</span> a lot longer than that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.739" end="00:02:57.660" style="s2">took about a year and a<span style="s4"> half</span> thousands</p>

<p begin="00:03:05.220" end="00:03:09.569" style="s2">things like that so<span style="s3"> it</span> actually was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.319" end="00:03:10.980" style="s2">pretty in-depth investigation that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.569" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">did so that&#39;s just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.980" end="00:03:18.209" style="s2">historical context<span style="s3"> okay</span> so going back to</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.350" end="00:06:52.010" style="s2">that interactive wheel on the Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.510" end="00:06:54.530" style="s2"><span style="s3">Reader</span> website<span style="s4"> okay</span> so I&#39;m<span style="s3"> going</span> to<span style="s3"> talk</span></p>
<p begin="00:06:52.010" end="00:06:56.630" style="s2">just briefly about how it looks if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.530" end="00:06:59.480" style="s2">have money or<span style="s3"> a</span> car or another asset</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.630" end="00:07:01.070" style="s2">that&#39;s taken from you so first<span style="s3"> officers</span></p>
<p begin="00:06:59.480" end="00:07:02.780" style="s2">stopped you and seized the property that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.070" end="00:07:05.030" style="s2">they suspect is involved in a legal</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.780" end="00:07:06.470" style="s2">activity then they have to<span style="s4"> go</span> to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.030" end="00:07:08.750" style="s2">Cook County State&#39;s Attorney&#39;s Office</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.470" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">say hey we think this is forfeitable</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.750" end="00:07:13.370" style="s2">what do you<span style="s4"> guys</span> think they<span style="s3"> say yes we</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:15.230" style="s2">agree and so then the civil process</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.370" end="00:07:17.060" style="s2">continues and that&#39;s when the<span style="s3"> actual</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:15.230" end="00:07:19.790" style="s2">legal process starts to go into<span style="s3"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:17.060" end="00:07:21.980" style="s2">courts the seizure is the<span style="s3"> one step</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:19.790" end="00:07:24.320" style="s2">convincing the court to allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.980" end="00:07:25.820" style="s2">legally keep the<span style="s4"> property</span> is a<span style="s3"> separate</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:24.320" end="00:07:30.320" style="s2">step that&#39;s forfeiture and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.820" end="00:07:32.930" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about here so i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.320" end="00:07:35.480" style="s2">show you an interactive of flow chart</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.930" end="00:07:36.830" style="s2">here<span style="s3"> i&#39;m</span> not going<span style="s3"> to</span> get into all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.480" end="00:07:39.920" style="s2">details as you&#39;ll see it gets very</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.830" end="00:07:42.830" style="s2">confusing but this is just a look at how</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.920" end="00:07:46.490" style="s2">the process works if it is you that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:48.410" style="s2">going through it so the average seizure</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.490" end="00:07:50.600" style="s2">in<span style="s4"> Illinois</span> is only five hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.410" end="00:07:52.010" style="s2">thirty dollars or the average median</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.600" end="00:07:53.420" style="s2">seizure and that&#39;s according<span style="s3"> to</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.010" end="00:07:57.350" style="s2">institute for justice which is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.420" end="00:07:59.030" style="s2">national civil libertarian organization</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.350" end="00:08:01.250" style="s2">that tracks civil forfeiture across the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.030" end="00:08:03.170" style="s2">country for our purposes we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.250" end="00:08:06.820" style="s2">look at what would<span style="s3"> happen</span> if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.170" end="00:08:09.140" style="s2">thousand dollars taken off<span style="s4"> of</span> you so</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.820" end="00:08:11.600" style="s2">there are several different outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.140" end="00:08:14.210" style="s2">most of them is<span style="s4"> that</span> you lose there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.600" end="00:08:17.060" style="s2">two ways<span style="s4"> that</span> you win almost<span style="s3"> always</span> you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.210" end="00:08:18.710" style="s2">lose<span style="s4"> a</span><span style="s3"> yeah</span> it&#39;s rare that you would so</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.060" end="00:08:21.560" style="s2">the first step is that the department</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.710" end="00:08:23.090" style="s2">itself after seizing it says actually we</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.560" end="00:08:26.210" style="s2">don&#39;t<span style="s3"> have</span> probable cause and in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.090" end="00:08:28.070" style="s2"><span style="s3">case</span> you<span style="s3"> get</span> your full $1,000 back but</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.210" end="00:08:30.050" style="s2">you only<span style="s4"> have</span> 30 days to get<span style="s4"> it</span> you<span style="s3"> got</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:28.070" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">to go down<span style="s4"> to</span> the evidence<span style="s3"> and</span> evidence</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.050" end="00:08:35.990" style="s2">and identify yeah you go to<span style="s4"> an</span> office</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:38.780" style="s2">and home in square the west side black</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.990" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">site that they run and you say hey give</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.780" end="00:08:42.140" style="s2">me<span style="s4"> my</span> money and they do but if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:44.900" style="s2">do that within 30 days they&#39;re allowed</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.140" end="00:08:49.010" style="s2">to keep it the second aspect is that if</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.900" end="00:08:51.140" style="s2">early on in the court process when CPD</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.010" end="00:08:53.450" style="s2">tries to prove probable cause to a judge</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.140" end="00:08:54.030" style="s2">to allow them to start the process<span style="s3"> in</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:53.450" end="00:08:56.670" style="s2">full</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.030" end="00:08:58.410" style="s2">that very first probable cause hearing</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.670" end="00:09:00.180" style="s2">judge says that they don&#39;t have<span style="s3"> it</span></p>
<p begin="00:08:58.410" end="00:09:03.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the only case in which you<span style="s3"> get</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:00.180" end="00:09:05.310" style="s2">all<span style="s4"> your</span> money back in every other every</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.000" end="00:09:07.950" style="s2">other scenario you&#39;re going to lose<span style="s3"> some</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:05.310" end="00:09:09.780" style="s2">bit of<span style="s3"> money</span> so one is that<span style="s3"> you</span><span style="s4"> don&#39;t</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:07.950" end="00:09:12.420" style="s2"><span style="s3">even</span><span style="s4"> fight</span> it so your thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.780" end="00:09:15.180" style="s2">is gone from<span style="s3"> the</span> get-go but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.420" end="00:09:17.070" style="s2">lose any money in court costs the second</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.180" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">step is that you start going<span style="s4"> through</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.070" end="00:09:22.650" style="s2">court process this<span style="s3"> entails</span> paying about</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:25.230" style="s2"><span style="s3">a</span> two-hundred-dollar appearance fee some</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.650" end="00:09:26.910" style="s2">ranges between like 170 and two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.230" end="00:09:30.510" style="s2"><span style="s4">twenty</span> dollars and you have to put a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.910" end="00:09:32.250" style="s2">bond down on your asset that was seized</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.510" end="00:09:33.510" style="s2">so in our case if it&#39;s a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.250" end="00:09:35.400" style="s2">dollars cash you have to put up<span style="s3"> a</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:33.510" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">hundred dollars if it was a thirteen</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.400" end="00:09:39.240" style="s2">thousand dollar vehicle then you would</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">have to put<span style="s4"> up</span> 13 hundred dollars and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.240" end="00:09:45.720" style="s2">goes up<span style="s4"> from</span> there at some point doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:48.300" style="s2"><span style="s3">it</span> so yet so let&#39;s pause here the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.720" end="00:09:50.010" style="s2">average seizure is 530 bucks if<span style="s3"> you</span> want</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.300" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">to challenge it in court you&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.010" end="00:09:58.740" style="s2">up already<span style="s4"> $300</span> yeah so like forget<span style="s4"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:10:01.650" style="s2">let&#39;s say that<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> your Yeah Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.740" end="00:10:03.690" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s<span style="s3"> your</span> house right if your</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.650" end="00:10:06.420" style="s2">house is 130 thousand dollars you have</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.690" end="00:10:10.020" style="s2">to put up 13 thousand dollars plus your</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.420" end="00:10:13.080" style="s2">$200 appearance fee so you can see like</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.020" end="00:10:14.760" style="s2">why there&#39;s such a descent if four</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.080" end="00:10:21.600" style="s2">people would<span style="s4"> even</span> go to court to</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.760" end="00:10:23.070" style="s2">challenge it question I mean I<span style="s4"> guess</span> you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.600" end="00:10:24.930" style="s2"><span style="s4">should</span> ask cook county state&#39;s attorney</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.070" end="00:10:26.790" style="s2">or the Illinois State German I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.930" end="00:10:29.280" style="s2">well so part of that bond fee goes</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.790" end="00:10:34.670" style="s2">toward paying the administrative costs</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.280" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">of the court so that&#39;s partially that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.670" end="00:10:38.760" style="s2">that&#39;s correct oh yeah I think so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:42.690" style="s2">but the real answer is you should ask</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.760" end="00:10:44.550" style="s2">the Illinois State Legislature but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.690" end="00:10:50.910" style="s2">it&#39;s for paying for court administrative</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.550" end="00:10:52.520" style="s2">costs good so you<span style="s4"> go</span> yeah and<span style="s3"> you</span> don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.910" end="00:10:56.040" style="s2">get it back even if you win that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.520" end="00:10:58.020" style="s2">that&#39;s not<span style="s3"> true</span> well sorry<span style="s3"> okay okay</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:56.040" end="00:11:00.210" style="s2"><span style="s3">okay</span> so there there are<span style="s3"> certain</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:58.020" end="00:11:03.990" style="s2">scenarios in which you may get part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.210" end="00:11:06.270" style="s2"><span style="s3">your</span> fee or all of your feedback well</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.990" end="00:11:07.440" style="s2">never all of your fee the bond even<span style="s4"> if</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:06.270" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">you<span style="s3"> win</span> you lose</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:12.150" style="s2">ten percent of it ten percent of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:14.130" style="s2">ten percent bond is always lost even if</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.150" end="00:11:17.460" style="s2">you<span style="s4"> win</span> because<span style="s3"> that</span> goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.130" end="00:11:19.770" style="s2"><span style="s3">administrative</span><span style="s4"> cost</span> of the program there</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.460" end="00:11:21.690" style="s2">are moments early<span style="s3"> on</span> in the process in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.770" end="00:11:23.520" style="s2">which the state&#39;s attorney&#39;s office may</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.690" end="00:11:25.260" style="s2">offer you a settlement and if<span style="s3"> that&#39;s the</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:23.520" end="00:11:27.660" style="s2"><span style="s4">case</span> then<span style="s4"> that</span> two hundred dollar fee</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.260" end="00:11:32.040" style="s2">that you pay to appear in<span style="s4"> court</span> may be</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.660" end="00:11:34.530" style="s2">returned to you and but again<span style="s3"> that</span> bond</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.040" end="00:11:36.030" style="s2">would not be returned to you so there</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.530" end="00:11:38.370" style="s2">are<span style="s3"> different</span> scenarios and it gets a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.030" end="00:11:40.950" style="s2">little complicated but for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.370" end="00:11:43.590" style="s2">if<span style="s3"> you</span> get any length into this process</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.950" end="00:11:47.870" style="s2">then at least part of those fees are</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.590" end="00:11:54.360" style="s2">just gone there are<span style="s3"> other</span> questions or</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.870" end="00:11:56.190" style="s2">we can continue ok cool oh cool um so</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:11:58.200" style="s2">then yeah so we&#39;ve gone<span style="s3"> through</span> two ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.190" end="00:11:59.820" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> you<span style="s3"> lose</span> the worst way that you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.200" end="00:12:01.350" style="s2"><span style="s3">lose</span> is that you go all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.820" end="00:12:04.890" style="s2"><span style="s3">the</span> process you actually get to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.350" end="00:12:06.750" style="s2">civil trial and they&#39;ve rule in CPD&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.890" end="00:12:08.520" style="s2">favor and if<span style="s3"> that&#39;s the case</span> then<span style="s3"> not</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:06.750" end="00:12:09.900" style="s2">only do you lose the one thousand</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.520" end="00:12:11.610" style="s2">dollars that<span style="s3"> you</span> started with but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.900" end="00:12:13.920" style="s2">also lose the roughly three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.610" end="00:12:18.930" style="s2">dollars worth of fees that you pay so</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.920" end="00:12:21.270" style="s2">your net loss is<span style="s3"> 1300</span><span style="s4"> okay</span> so<span style="s4"> I&#39;m</span><span style="s3"> just</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:18.930" end="00:12:24.570" style="s2">going<span style="s4"> to</span> scroll through these slides</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.270" end="00:12:26.250" style="s2">real quick this is the flowchart that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.570" end="00:12:28.980" style="s2">were talking about<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span><span style="s4"> complicated</span> i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.250" end="00:12:32.390" style="s2">not going<span style="s4"> to</span><span style="s3"> go</span> into it<span style="s3"> exactly but as</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:28.980" end="00:12:38.280" style="s2">you can see there&#39;s three layers here</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.390" end="00:12:42.060" style="s2">yeah so the main takeaways from this are</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.280" end="00:12:44.910" style="s2">every arrow in the scenario is a length</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.060" end="00:12:46.860" style="s2"><span style="s3">of</span> time it takes many<span style="s3"> days</span> the police</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.910" end="00:12:49.530" style="s2">department has between<span style="s3"> five</span> days if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.860" end="00:12:51.180" style="s2">a car or<span style="s3"> 52</span> days if<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span> cash to tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.530" end="00:12:53.400" style="s2">the state&#39;s<span style="s4"> attorneys</span> that<span style="s3"> they</span> want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.180" end="00:12:56.190" style="s2">keep it the state&#39;s attorneys has 45</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.400" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">days to tell the court that it&#39;s<span style="s3"> seeking</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:56.190" end="00:13:00.900" style="s2">to keep it so all of this<span style="s3"> time</span> is time</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:03.270" style="s2">in which you are living without your</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.900" end="00:13:04.920" style="s2">money or your car or your house or your</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.270" end="00:13:06.450" style="s2">house<span style="s3"> although</span> it&#39;s a little quicker if</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.920" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">it&#39;s your house because<span style="s4"> they</span> take<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:06.450" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2"><span style="s4">idea</span><span style="s3"> yeah</span> uh but throughout this process</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:15.690" style="s2">the burden of proof is on the claimant</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:18.180" style="s2">so the Cook County<span style="s4"> State&#39;s</span> Attorney&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.690" end="00:13:20.460" style="s2">Office and<span style="s4"> the</span> police department<span style="s3"> only</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:18.180" end="00:13:21.180" style="s2">have to prove probable cause they<span style="s3"> only</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:20.460" end="00:13:22.950" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.180" end="00:13:25.020" style="s2">act your asset to a crime through</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.950" end="00:13:27.390" style="s2">probable cause which as I&#39;m sure many of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.020" end="00:13:30.630" style="s2">you know is the low standard of proof</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.390" end="00:13:33.090" style="s2">that they need<span style="s4"> to</span> look at<span style="s4"> your</span> car at a</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.630" end="00:13:35.550" style="s2">traffic stop it&#39;s not an evidentiary</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.090" end="00:13:37.650" style="s2">standard and probable cause here means</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.550" end="00:13:39.990" style="s2">they only have to prove that<span style="s4"> they</span><span style="s3"> took</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:37.650" end="00:13:41.280" style="s2"><span style="s4">it</span> with probable<span style="s3"> cause not that there</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:39.990" end="00:13:43.410" style="s2"><span style="s4">was</span> probable cause<span style="s4"> that</span> you actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.280" end="00:13:45.150" style="s2">committed<span style="s4"> a</span> crime so you can like<span style="s4"> me</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:43.410" end="00:13:48.570" style="s2">clear to the crime and still have<span style="s3"> your</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:45.150" end="00:13:52.050" style="s2">stuff taken you so probable cause here</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.570" end="00:13:54.870" style="s2"><span style="s4">only</span> means probable cause to see or to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.050" end="00:13:59.310" style="s2">forfeit the stuff and do the seizure</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.870" end="00:14:02.760" style="s2">process through the courts yeah so then</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.310" end="00:14:04.950" style="s2">the other takeaway is<span style="s3"> that</span> because<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:02.760" end="00:14:07.260" style="s2">a<span style="s3"> civil</span> process in not a<span style="s3"> criminal</span> case</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.950" end="00:14:09.900" style="s2">there&#39;s no court appointed attorney you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.260" end="00:14:11.850" style="s2">don&#39;t get a public defender so as a huge</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.900" end="00:14:14.070" style="s2">disadvantage to a regular everyday</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.850" end="00:14:17.460" style="s2">claimant who&#39;s going up against a team</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.070" end="00:14:18.990" style="s2">of lawyers that<span style="s4"> are</span> hired through the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.460" end="00:14:20.550" style="s2">state&#39;s attorney&#39;s office<span style="s3"> and</span> that deal</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.990" end="00:14:23.130" style="s2"><span style="s3">with</span> these cases day after day week</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.550" end="00:14:24.750" style="s2">after week and a roster of judges that</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.130" end="00:14:29.700" style="s2">hear these cases day after day week</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.750" end="00:14:34.110" style="s2">after week I&#39;m just<span style="s3"> going</span><span style="s4"> to</span><span style="s3"> go</span><span style="s4"> through</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:29.700" end="00:14:35.370" style="s2">here so I just check<span style="s3"> out</span> the flowchart</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.110" end="00:14:38.070" style="s2">for yourself yeah<span style="s3"> in</span> the Chicago Reader</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.370" end="00:14:40.830" style="s2">story so to reiterate it&#39;s a<span style="s3"> civil</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:38.070" end="00:14:42.660" style="s2">action the legal<span style="s3"> protections</span> that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.830" end="00:14:46.530" style="s2">with you during a criminal case are not</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.660" end="00:14:48.840" style="s2">with you during the civil case and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.530" end="00:14:52.920" style="s2">burden of proof is on the claimant not</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.840" end="00:14:55.080" style="s2">on the state so we<span style="s3"> have</span> still have some</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.920" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">open questions the biggest<span style="s4"> one</span> that<span style="s3"> we</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:55.080" end="00:15:00.330" style="s2">try<span style="s3"> to</span> address that we got no answers</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:02.610" style="s2">for was what does<span style="s3"> this</span> program look like</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.330" end="00:15:05.010" style="s2">racially I mean we know that the word on</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.610" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">drugs is applied asymmetrically to pour</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.010" end="00:15:10.470" style="s2">in brown people so we try<span style="s4"> to</span> figure out</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:12.270" style="s2">whose stuff is getting seized and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.470" end="00:15:13.890" style="s2"><span style="s4">state&#39;s</span> attorney wouldn&#39;t tell us<span style="s3"> we</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:12.270" end="00:15:16.950" style="s2"><span style="s3">tried to file FOIA as I said it was too</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:13.890" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2"><span style="s4">much</span> work even though it&#39;s really not I</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.950" end="00:15:21.570" style="s2">mean it but it&#39;s actually<span style="s3"> a</span> really hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:25.080" style="s2">question to answer if you don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.570" end="00:15:26.910" style="s2">actually do this stuff every day so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.080" end="00:15:29.580" style="s2">try to answer that question we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.910" end="00:15:31.380" style="s2">know what the answer<span style="s4"> is</span> um we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.580" end="00:15:32.850" style="s2">the breakdown of seizures so we know</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.380" end="00:15:34.950" style="s2">what the average seizure looks like</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.850" end="00:15:36.750" style="s2">these<span style="s3"> laws</span><span style="s4"> were</span> enacted</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.950" end="00:15:38.310" style="s2">it you know in<span style="s4"> the</span> 80s because<span style="s4"> we&#39;re</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:36.750" end="00:15:40.500" style="s2">going<span style="s3"> to</span> take down Pablo Escobar and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.310" end="00:15:41.340" style="s2">we&#39;re going<span style="s3"> to</span> take tony montana&#39;s money</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.500" end="00:15:43.410" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to cripple his</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.340" end="00:15:44.880" style="s2">organization um but if the average</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.410" end="00:15:47.250" style="s2">seizure is like five hundred and thirty</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.880" end="00:15:49.410" style="s2">dollars that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.250" end="00:15:51.630" style="s2">from the people that<span style="s4"> we</span> met in court<span style="s4"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:49.410" end="00:15:53.820" style="s2">the reporting that Joel did that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.630" end="00:15:56.190" style="s2">seem to<span style="s3"> be</span> the case um but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.820" end="00:15:58.020" style="s2"><span style="s4">actually</span> don&#39;t know um these<span style="s3"> are these</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:56.190" end="00:15:59.760" style="s2">are again kind<span style="s3"> of</span> open and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.020" end="00:16:01.590" style="s2">reason we<span style="s3"> don&#39;t</span> know is when the<span style="s3"> Chicago</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:59.760" end="00:16:03.630" style="s2"><span style="s3">Police Department takes money and then</span></p>
<p begin="00:16:01.590" end="00:16:05.910" style="s2">sends it along to the Illinois State</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.630" end="00:16:07.470" style="s2">Police which administers the fun in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.910" end="00:16:09.240" style="s2">interim period between seizure and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.470" end="00:16:12.000" style="s2">forfeiture they lump all that money</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.240" end="00:16:15.290" style="s2">together so when we we were able to FOIA</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:17.760" style="s2">for deposit slips to show how much money</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.290" end="00:16:20.610" style="s2">CPD&#39;s forfeiture account was making</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.760" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">month by month since 2009 to the present</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.610" end="00:16:24.540" style="s2">but it was on these lump sum checks from</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:26.070" style="s2">the<span style="s4"> Illinois</span> State<span style="s3"> release</span> not the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.540" end="00:16:29.670" style="s2">individual so yeah so what we see is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.070" end="00:16:33.030" style="s2">like one deposit 4.5 million dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.670" end="00:16:34.470" style="s2">then the<span style="s4"> next</span> month we&#39;ll see like forty</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.030" end="00:16:36.270" style="s2">dollars or something<span style="s3"> that&#39;s</span> not exact</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.470" end="00:16:40.200" style="s2">figures but anyway that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.270" end="00:16:42.210" style="s2">challenge we found and then total</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.200" end="00:16:44.760" style="s2">expenditures being spent we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.210" end="00:16:46.770" style="s2">still not sure about<span style="s3"> that I&#39;ll describe</span></p>
<p begin="00:16:44.760" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">briefly what we did in our analysis</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.770" end="00:16:54.780" style="s2">Jonah I guess I can I can do<span style="s4"> this okay</span></p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:57.690" style="s2">cool so we had hundreds of checks so</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.780" end="00:16:59.850" style="s2">what we did was we<span style="s3"> focused</span> on every</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.690" end="00:17:01.770" style="s2">expenditure that CPD did<span style="s3"> above</span> five</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.899" end="00:19:20.070" style="s2">they spent like six percent of their</p>

<p begin="00:20:05.660" end="00:20:10.940" style="s2">that<span style="s3"> makes</span> sense so all the ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.660" end="00:20:15.290" style="s2">analyzed above five thousand dollars it</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.940" end="00:20:16.850" style="s2">was about 25 million so we analyzed</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.290" end="00:20:20.510" style="s2">about 25<span style="s3"> million</span> dollars of all the</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.740" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t really know we&#39;re<span style="s3"> getting</span> into</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.450" end="00:24:57.130" style="s2">like if<span style="s4"> I had known a year</span><span style="s3"> and</span> a half</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:58.570" style="s2">ago that this is how long<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:57.130" end="00:24:59.830" style="s2">investigation would have taken<span style="s4"> I</span> would</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.570" end="00:25:03.040" style="s2">have been<span style="s3"> like</span> all right I&#39;m going<span style="s3"> to go</span></p>

<p begin="00:25:03.040" end="00:25:08.740" style="s2">yeah<span style="s3"> boyer</span> actually really was the only</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.380" end="00:25:10.180" style="s2">tool that we could use for this and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.740" end="00:25:11.710" style="s2">was<span style="s3"> really</span> powerful it was also</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.180" end="00:25:13.270" style="s2">extremely aggravating because we had<span style="s4"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:11.710" end="00:25:16.900" style="s2">file like multiple lawsuits and things</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.270" end="00:25:18.730" style="s2">like that<span style="s3"> so</span> yeah those are like three</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.900" end="00:25:20.380" style="s2">big takeaways and I guess the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.730" end="00:25:21.670" style="s2">that Joel and I wanted<span style="s3"> saying</span> is you</p>

<p begin="00:25:21.670" end="00:25:24.690" style="s2">only way to reform this</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.260" end="00:25:31.940" style="s2">like that&#39;s it that&#39;s<span style="s3"> me</span> I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.230" end="00:25:34.850" style="s2">all we have but also that&#39;s the way to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.940" end="00:25:37.460" style="s2">fix all<span style="s3"> of</span> this stuff and then I guess</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.850" end="00:25:40.610" style="s2">we&#39;ll take questions now I have you</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.460" end="00:25:44.690" style="s2">thought about<span style="s4"> the</span> you get a money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.610" end="00:25:47.270" style="s2">legally seize but I know<span style="s3"> if it&#39;s uh from</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:44.690" end="00:25:49.490" style="s2">myself I<span style="s4"> yourself</span> a<span style="s3"> business</span> Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.270" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">what about the illegal money that cops</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.490" end="00:25:54.260" style="s2">take off<span style="s4"> a</span><span style="s3"> people</span> if you got any data on</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:56.120" style="s2">that because they used to<span style="s3"> basically</span> rob</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.260" end="00:25:58.070" style="s2">people in<span style="s4"> a</span> lot<span style="s3"> of</span> bars and cash</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.120" end="00:26:00.170" style="s2">business I get short money from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:03.190" style="s2">river every week so it&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.170" end="00:26:05.270" style="s2">money involved in that thing you should</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.190" end="00:26:07.400" style="s2">investigate the illegal money it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.270" end="00:26:09.080" style="s2">that<span style="s4"> yours</span> you&#39;re talking about money</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.400" end="00:26:13.160" style="s2">that cops take that they don&#39;t account</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.080" end="00:26:16.520" style="s2">for yeah yeah yeah you&#39;re right that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.160" end="00:26:18.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge problem there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.520" end="00:26:22.130" style="s2">lawsuit that we<span style="s4"> mentioned</span> in the article</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.260" end="00:26:24.740" style="s2">that<span style="s4"> was</span> the gates vs chicago which was</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.130" end="00:26:28.460" style="s2">a man who in the course of his<span style="s3"> arrest</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:24.740" end="00:26:30.290" style="s2">the police took like 110 or 130 dollars</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.460" end="00:26:32.270" style="s2">off of him<span style="s3"> and</span> they never accounted for</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.290" end="00:26:34.220" style="s2">it and when he started fighting them to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.270" end="00:26:35.960" style="s2"><span style="s3">get</span> his money back they<span style="s3"> found</span> that there</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.220" end="00:26:40.370" style="s2">were 40,000 other<span style="s3"> people</span> that had</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.960" end="00:26:45.470" style="s2">happened to so since 2010 when the city</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.370" end="00:26:46.580" style="s2">made a settlement there seems<span style="s3"> to</span> be like</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.470" end="00:26:49.430" style="s2">they&#39;ve gotten a little better about</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:51.050" style="s2">that they&#39;ve at least made sure to</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.430" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">account for it in made sure that it goes</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.050" end="00:26:55.430" style="s2"><span style="s4">through</span> this process but<span style="s3"> i&#39;m</span> sure<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:59.510" style="s2">it&#39;s<span style="s3"> still</span> happening and we don&#39;t<span style="s3"> know</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:55.430" end="00:27:02.300" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> it<span style="s4"> i&#39;m i&#39;m just wondering if you</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:59.510" end="00:27:04.160" style="s2">could<span style="s3"> say</span> what in that 1505 section of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.300" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">the law what assets in particular are</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.160" end="00:27:10.180" style="s2">subject to forfeiture to<span style="s3"> seizure</span> if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:14.420" style="s2">stopped on the side of the road yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.180" end="00:27:16.700" style="s2">so first off cash cash that you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.420" end="00:27:19.670" style="s2">audio if you are caught with like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.700" end="00:27:21.380" style="s2">relatively small amount of drugs<span style="s3"> and</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.670" end="00:27:22.910" style="s2">lot<span style="s4"> of money on you then they&#39;re</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:21.380" end="00:27:25.160" style="s2"><span style="s4">probably</span> just going to assume that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.910" end="00:27:26.690" style="s2">money was made through either selling</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.160" end="00:27:28.310" style="s2">those drugs or that you were going<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:26.690" end="00:27:30.200" style="s2"><span style="s3">use that money to buy more and that&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:28.310" end="00:27:32.210" style="s2">that inference is all they need they</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.200" end="00:27:36.950" style="s2">don&#39;t need anything more<span style="s3"> than</span> that but</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.210" end="00:27:38.450" style="s2">then cars are<span style="s4"> the</span> second largest in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.950" end="00:27:42.140" style="s2">lot<span style="s4"> of</span> times</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.450" end="00:27:44.390" style="s2">it&#39;s kids or spouses or your uncle who</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.140" end="00:27:45.950" style="s2">borrows your car to go pick up drugs to</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.390" end="00:27:49.580" style="s2">go sell drugs and you don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.950" end="00:27:53.000" style="s2"><span style="s3">it but then you</span><span style="s4"> have</span> to go to court and</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.580" end="00:27:58.040" style="s2">say hey I didn&#39;t know<span style="s3"> that so and so was</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:53.000" end="00:28:00.080" style="s2">using this to go pick up but as far as</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.040" end="00:28:02.420" style="s2">other assets I mean they&#39;ve taken TVs</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.080" end="00:28:05.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve<span style="s4"> taken</span><span style="s3"> PlayStation</span> beats</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.420" end="00:28:07.970" style="s2">headphones they love 50-inch plasma TVs</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.720" end="00:28:09.950" style="s2">so like<span style="s4"> L</span> Brian who&#39;s in the back over</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.970" end="00:28:11.450" style="s2"><span style="s4">there</span> he got like Cook County&#39;s asset</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.950" end="00:28:13.640" style="s2">forfeiture stuff and it&#39;s 50 inch</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.450" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">plasmas like they&#39;re really<span style="s4"> gonna</span> crack</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.640" end="00:28:20.150" style="s2">down on these drug rings<span style="s3"> by</span> yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:22.010" style="s2">again it&#39;s anything that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.150" end="00:28:24.470" style="s2"><span style="s3">furtherance</span> of a crime is how the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.010" end="00:28:27.260" style="s2">statute defines it so it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.470" end="00:28:28.820" style="s2">use your cell phone to buy drugs they</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.260" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">can seize yourself and if you<span style="s3"> use</span> your</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.820" end="00:28:33.260" style="s2">computer to do it they can<span style="s3"> seize</span> your</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:35.180" style="s2">computer and it&#39;s also like that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.260" end="00:28:37.130" style="s2">an open question because like they can</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.180" end="00:28:39.170" style="s2">also just take stuff that&#39;s nearby other</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.130" end="00:28:41.150" style="s2">stuff so like<span style="s4"> they</span> get automatically</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.170" end="00:28:43.100" style="s2">yeah they can also like money clear out</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.150" end="00:28:45.260" style="s2">your living room because like you had a</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.100" end="00:28:47.570" style="s2">scale there and they took<span style="s3"> a</span> scale and oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.260" end="00:28:51.260" style="s2">the TV&#39;s nearby and that&#39;s also<span style="s3"> very</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:47.570" end="00:28:55.810" style="s2">legally questionable so it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.260" end="00:28:55.810" style="s2">can&#39;t even<span style="s3"> do</span> it in like an hour so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.620" end="00:29:02.390" style="s2">so yeah so Lucy Parsons lab is a</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.660" end="00:29:30.020" style="s2">interesting yeah the short answer is no</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.490" end="00:29:34.340" style="s2">but the<span style="s3"> way that the law breaks down in</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:30.020" end="00:29:35.990" style="s2"><span style="s3">Illinois</span> and in other states is that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.340" end="00:29:39.110" style="s2">criminal process in<span style="s4"> the</span> civil process</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.990" end="00:29:42.860" style="s2">are distinct so you go to court for the</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.860" end="00:29:50.150" style="s2">TV goes to court it goes to civil court</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.310" end="00:29:51.980" style="s2">separately so there I went down to court</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.150" end="00:29:53.809" style="s2">many<span style="s4"> different</span> days</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.980" end="00:29:56.540" style="s2">the civil court and there were<span style="s3"> plenty</span> of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.809" end="00:29:58.669" style="s2">people there that had been acquitted of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.540" end="00:30:00.980" style="s2">the crime or their spouse or their kid</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.669" end="00:30:03.500" style="s2">had been acquitted of the crime and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.980" end="00:30:05.510" style="s2">were there to<span style="s4"> go</span> through the civil</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.500" end="00:30:08.840" style="s2">process to get the<span style="s3"> money</span> or the car back</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.840" end="00:30:12.290" style="s2">that but it&#39;s plenty of people so and</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.210" end="00:30:14.059" style="s2">then the<span style="s4"> other</span> thing is<span style="s4"> that</span> like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.290" end="00:30:16.280" style="s2">also hard to look<span style="s4"> for</span> that stuff in<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:30:14.059" end="00:30:18.440" style="s2">civil process because you have to know</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.280" end="00:30:20.299" style="s2">because<span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span> also like CPD versus nine</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.220" end="00:31:50.150" style="s2">CPD right we also have a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.740" end="00:31:52.429" style="s2">documents for like Cook County Illinois</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.150" end="00:31:54.530" style="s2">State Police loves to spend asset</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.510" end="00:32:37.820" style="s2">live here but it happens across the</p>

<p begin="00:35:46.700" end="00:35:52.380" style="s2">secondly did you look at segregating the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.040" end="00:35:54.420" style="s2">data by zip code to see so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.380" end="00:35:57.750" style="s2"><span style="s4">exactly</span><span style="s3"> what</span> we tried to do<span style="s3"> okay</span> so we</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.420" end="00:35:59.400" style="s2">tried to so when when we fired so when</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.750" end="00:36:02.190" style="s2">the Cook County State&#39;s Attorney&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.400" end="00:36:04.740" style="s2">Office sends a letter of intent<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:36:02.190" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">seizure they it&#39;s<span style="s3"> actually</span> like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.740" end="00:36:10.109" style="s2"><span style="s4">physical</span> letter they say this much<span style="s3"> money</span></p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:14.990" style="s2">we intend<span style="s3"> to</span> keep it you have X number</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.109" end="00:36:16.980" style="s2">of days so what I did was I fired the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.990" end="00:36:18.329" style="s2">state&#39;s attorney&#39;s office<span style="s3"> and</span> I said</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.980" end="00:36:20.490" style="s2">look<span style="s4"> I</span> know that there&#39;s probably</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.490" end="00:36:25.589" style="s2">civil legislation I don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.010" end="00:36:26.970" style="s2"><span style="s3">that</span> give me a year&#39;s worth and just</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.589" end="00:36:28.910" style="s2">read act out everything but the zip code</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.970" end="00:36:31.430" style="s2">because even if that doesn&#39;t give me an</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.910" end="00:36:33.500" style="s2">thing<span style="s3"> I</span> can know you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.430" end="00:36:35.390" style="s2">statistics of other statistics right we</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.500" end="00:36:37.280" style="s2">know like the general breakdown you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.390" end="00:36:39.260" style="s2">they&#39;re probably not a lot of<span style="s4"> those</span> that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.280" end="00:36:42.950" style="s2"><span style="s3">get</span> sent in you know this zip code</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.260" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">versus like<span style="s4"> Englewood</span> but they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.950" end="00:36:47.930" style="s2">give<span style="s4"> me</span> that either um<span style="s3"> because</span> I said it</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:50.030" style="s2">would<span style="s3"> be</span> too<span style="s4"> much</span> work for them um so</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.930" end="00:36:52.070" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s exactly<span style="s3"> the</span> approach we</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.030" end="00:36:54.380" style="s2">try to take like find out data by zip</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.070" end="00:36:56.750" style="s2">code but they wouldn&#39;t even bite on that</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.380" end="00:36:59.210" style="s2">so they said<span style="s3"> that</span> we could go to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.750" end="00:37:01.880" style="s2">circuit court<span style="s3"> the</span> records section and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.210" end="00:37:04.820" style="s2">pull the letters ourselves which we try</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.880" end="00:37:06.950" style="s2">to do you can pull<span style="s3"> ten</span> at a<span style="s3"> time</span> and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.820" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">there are thousands for every year so</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.950" end="00:37:14.630" style="s2">just to pull them to come up<span style="s4"> with</span> a zip</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:17.060" style="s2">code did it make sense timewise so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.630" end="00:37:19.910" style="s2"><span style="s3">the</span> data<span style="s3"> that</span> you have<span style="s3"> is</span> a public or is</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.060" end="00:37:22.340" style="s2">there like in<span style="s4"> the</span> public access the data</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.910" end="00:37:24.530" style="s2">that you guys have yes some letters out</p>
