<p begin="00:06:55.100" end="00:06:59.300" style="s2">we just pulled a few report titles to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.500" end="00:07:02.090" style="s2">kind of give you a sampling of what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.300" end="00:07:03.380" style="s2">reports actually look<span style="s4"> like</span> and so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.090" end="00:07:05.030" style="s2">title in each case kind of gives<span style="s3"> you</span></p>

<p begin="00:07:05.030" end="00:07:08.580" style="s2">in there what we looked at and if<span style="s3"> we</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:07.490" end="00:07:10.770" style="s2">made a recommendation</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.580" end="00:07:12.840" style="s2">to the federal agency what that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.770" end="00:07:14.759" style="s2">recommendation may be entailed and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.840" end="00:07:16.710" style="s2">you<span style="s4"> know</span> for<span style="s3"> the</span> flood insurance report</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.159" end="00:07:25.740" style="s2">for<span style="s4"> them</span> we have one here<span style="s3"> on FAA</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:23.460" end="00:07:27.449" style="s2">forecasting talking about what FAA</p>

<p begin="00:07:27.449" end="00:07:31.770" style="s2">forecasting activity and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.550" end="00:07:33.449" style="s2">review where we<span style="s3"> went</span> in we looked at</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.770" end="00:07:35.159" style="s2">what they&#39;re forecasting entailed<span style="s3"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:33.449" end="00:07:36.719" style="s2">came out with<span style="s4"> some recommendations on</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:35.159" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">how they could improve that going</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.719" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">forward so just kind of a snapshot but</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:42.180" style="s2">if you went<span style="s4"> to</span><span style="s3"> the</span><span style="s4"> website</span> you<span style="s3"> can</span> see a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:45.090" style="s2">whole lot<span style="s4"> of</span> reports and a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.180" end="00:07:46.500" style="s2">different topics and just<span style="s3"> briefly</span> we</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.090" end="00:07:48.030" style="s2">wanted to kind<span style="s4"> of</span> give an overview of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.500" end="00:07:50.520" style="s2"><span style="s3">some</span> of the methods we do use to do our</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.030" end="00:07:52.500" style="s2">work so whenever we get a<span style="s3"> request</span> or we</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.520" end="00:07:55.080" style="s2">have a mandate in law we<span style="s3"> always</span> start by</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.500" end="00:07:56.610" style="s2">designing our review so we very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.080" end="00:07:58.830" style="s2">define the scope of<span style="s3"> what</span> we&#39;re going<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:07:56.610" end="00:08:00.539" style="s2">look at and then we lay out the methods</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.830" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">both quantitative and qualitative we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.539" end="00:08:05.669" style="s2">going to use to collect and then review</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:08.099" style="s2">and analyze<span style="s3"> the</span> information so just some</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.669" end="00:08:09.750" style="s2">examples you know data and data analysis</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.099" end="00:08:11.669" style="s2">is something that we do often both</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.750" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">working with publicly available data</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.669" end="00:08:16.889" style="s2">sets as<span style="s4"> well</span> as other agency data sets</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:18.750" style="s2">and we don&#39;t just kind of take the data</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.889" end="00:08:20.159" style="s2">and run with it we always do a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.750" end="00:08:23.370" style="s2">extensive data reliability assessment</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.159" end="00:08:25.560" style="s2">for any data<span style="s3"> that</span> we use and when we</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.370" end="00:08:28.469" style="s2">publish the report in any findings we</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.560" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">include the results<span style="s3"> of</span> that as<span style="s4"> well</span> we</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.469" end="00:08:31.080" style="s2">do do investigative audits so in</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:32.789" style="s2">conjunction with some of these other</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.080" end="00:08:34.440" style="s2">methods we<span style="s3"> have</span> a team<span style="s3"> with</span> some</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.440" end="00:08:39.810" style="s2">allegations of fraud waste and abuse and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.050" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve had<span style="s4"> some</span> interesting and some</p>

<p begin="00:08:44.310" end="00:08:49.980" style="s2">focus groups and observation kind of as</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.589" end="00:08:52.019" style="s2">needed so surveys will often if there<span style="s3"> is</span></p>

<p begin="00:08:58.370" end="00:09:03.930" style="s2">for observation we put a graph up here</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:06.060" style="s2">some interesting<span style="s4"> work</span> we did both<span style="s3"> in</span> two</p>

<p begin="00:09:06.060" end="00:09:10.620" style="s2">with the<span style="s3"> election</span> coming up it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.649" end="00:09:12.690" style="s2">relevant again so on<span style="s3"> Election Day GAO</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:10.620" end="00:09:15.390" style="s2">said analysts and auditors out into the</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.140" end="00:09:22.499" style="s2">both looking<span style="s3"> at the entrances to the</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:21.329" end="00:09:24.239" style="s2">buildings and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.499" end="00:09:26.009" style="s2">in the polling places themselves looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.239" end="00:09:28.019" style="s2"><span style="s3">at</span> the voting machines<span style="s3"> to</span> see if they</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.019" end="00:09:31.319" style="s2">to the polling<span style="s3"> place</span> itself and then if</p>

<p begin="00:09:31.319" end="00:09:35.639" style="s2">and then finally we list interviews so</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.079" end="00:09:37.679" style="s2">that&#39;s something<span style="s4"> that</span> we pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.639" end="00:09:39.509" style="s2">always do we<span style="s3"> talk</span><span style="s4"> to</span> the agency</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.759" end="00:09:56.429" style="s2">qualitative information um so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.109" end="00:09:58.409" style="s2">kind of like all the broad overview</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.429" end="00:10:00.149" style="s2">stuff and then we<span style="s3"> just</span> wanted to<span style="s3"> hit</span> on</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.409" end="00:10:02.069" style="s2">three examples of reports to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.149" end="00:10:03.599" style="s2">give you a little<span style="s3"> more</span> of an<span style="s3"> idea</span> of</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.599" end="00:10:08.669" style="s2">what some of the findings are so with</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.569" end="00:10:11.129" style="s2">this first<span style="s3"> one</span> last year we did a report</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.669" end="00:10:13.319" style="s2">on pedestrian and cyclist safety this</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.129" end="00:10:15.659" style="s2"><span style="s3">was</span> a request that<span style="s3"> we</span> got<span style="s3"> in</span> both asking</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.549" end="00:10:21.779" style="s2">pedestrians and cyclists and then also</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.979" end="00:10:23.519" style="s2">kind of accompanying that with what</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.779" end="00:10:26.009" style="s2">efforts are underway at the federal</p>

<p begin="00:10:28.199" end="00:10:33.089" style="s2">of these<span style="s3"> groups</span> so what we did kind<span style="s3"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:10:31.470" end="00:10:35.699" style="s2">to look at the data was we took to</p>

<p begin="00:10:59.099" end="00:11:03.209" style="s2">sets and first we just<span style="s3"> kind</span> of looked at</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.109" end="00:11:06.629" style="s2">the change over the last<span style="s4"> ten</span> years so</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.209" end="00:11:09.629" style="s2">from 2004 to 2010 we found<span style="s4"> that</span><span style="s3"> overall</span></p>

<p begin="00:11:13.889" end="00:11:19.679" style="s2">actually represented a growing portion</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.479" end="00:11:21.749" style="s2">of all those fatalities so pedestrians</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.679" end="00:11:23.549" style="s2">for example in 2004 made up just under</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.749" end="00:11:26.339" style="s2">11 percent of all motor vehicle</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.339" end="00:16:52.970" style="s2">were<span style="s4"> 300</span> drugs with<span style="s3"> external</span> price</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.319" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">very few of<span style="s3"> them</span> were a thousand percent</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.420" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2"><span style="s3">or</span> more and kind of one interesting note</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:06.500" style="s2">that I<span style="s3"> thought</span> as<span style="s4"> well</span> even<span style="s3"> though</span> you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:08.270" style="s2">might have a price increase of 100 600</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.500" end="00:17:10.730" style="s2"><span style="s4">to</span> two hundred<span style="s3"> percent</span> or more you<span style="s3"> might</span></p>
<p begin="00:17:08.270" end="00:17:12.709" style="s2">still<span style="s3"> be</span><span style="s4"> looking</span> at very small prices so</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.730" end="00:17:14.419" style="s2">I<span style="s3"> think</span> hydrocortisone for example had a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.709" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2"><span style="s3">hundred</span> six hundred and sixty percent</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.419" end="00:17:19.490" style="s2">price increase for one of these time</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:22.010" style="s2">periods and it went<span style="s3"> from</span><span style="s4"> like</span> 14 cents</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.490" end="00:17:24.770" style="s2">to fifty cents per per dose of the cream</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.010" end="00:17:26.360" style="s2">something like that that was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.770" end="00:17:29.419" style="s2"><span style="s3">sort</span><span style="s4"> of</span> another interesting point about</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.360" end="00:17:31.700" style="s2">this is that again in general generic</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.419" end="00:17:33.380" style="s2">drug prices going down but of the drugs</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.700" end="00:17:35.390" style="s2">that had extraordinary price increases</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.380" end="00:17:38.590" style="s2">most of them were not of the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.390" end="00:17:40.429" style="s2">utilized drugs heavily utilized drugs so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.590" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting interesting</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.429" end="00:17:43.730" style="s2">report it&#39;s out there right now if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">have any interest in kind of like an</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.730" end="00:17:47.090" style="s2">overview of<span style="s3"> the drug industry as well</span></p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:49.159" style="s2">GAO reports are good for that this one</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.090" end="00:17:50.809" style="s2">in particular for<span style="s3"> this</span> we also looked at</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.159" end="00:17:52.190" style="s2">kind of what are the reasons behind drug</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.809" end="00:17:53.780" style="s2">price increases we did a lot<span style="s3"> of those</span></p>
<p begin="00:17:52.190" end="00:17:56.540" style="s2">interviews to kind of with experts to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.780" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">figure out why so that<span style="s3"> that&#39;s</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.540" end="00:18:02.450" style="s2"><span style="s3">healthcare</span> example<span style="s3"> all right and</span><span style="s4"> I</span> have</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:05.809" style="s2"><span style="s4">I</span><span style="s3"> have</span> the last example so hang in there</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.450" end="00:18:08.870" style="s2"><span style="s3">I</span> picked this example because<span style="s3"> I</span> worked</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.809" end="00:18:11.090" style="s2">on on one of these<span style="s4"> reports</span> and<span style="s3"> AIG</span> is</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.870" end="00:18:14.480" style="s2">hopefully familiar to you from the<span style="s3"> news</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:11.090" end="00:18:16.220" style="s2"><span style="s4">and</span> in 2008 so in September 2008 right</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.480" end="00:18:19.100" style="s2">after the fall of Lehman</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.220" end="00:18:22.610" style="s2">the government<span style="s4"> gate</span> provided<span style="s3"> AIG</span> with</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.100" end="00:18:25.909" style="s2">federal assistance of over 100 200 282</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.610" end="00:18:27.890" style="s2">billion dollars so this the<span style="s3"> government</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:25.909" end="00:18:29.659" style="s2">so basically<span style="s3"> what</span> you did is they</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.890" end="00:18:30.830" style="s2">provided a breakdown of the types of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.659" end="00:18:34.179" style="s2">federal<span style="s3"> systems</span> because they<span style="s3"> took</span> many</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.830" end="00:18:36.890" style="s2">forms and it also we created a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.179" end="00:18:39.409" style="s2">metrics for Congress to follow they were</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.890" end="00:18:43.460" style="s2">risk and repayment metrics and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.409" end="00:18:45.890" style="s2">reported on this through time and so so</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.460" end="00:18:48.950" style="s2">I I think this<span style="s4"> is this is a good example</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:45.890" end="00:18:50.539" style="s2">of how<span style="s4"> we</span> use a lot of publicly</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.950" end="00:18:54.020" style="s2">available information from different</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.539" end="00:18:55.580" style="s2">sources to kind of provide good</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.020" end="00:18:58.850" style="s2">indicators for Congress and the public</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.580" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">if we&#39;re we&#39;re concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:02.900" style="s2">federal assistance to AIG and see if</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">they&#39;re the status of the assistance so</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.900" end="00:19:07.610" style="s2">so like I said the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:09.620" style="s2">assistant took the assistance took many</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.610" end="00:19:13.419" style="s2">forms there was a line of<span style="s3"> credit</span> it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.620" end="00:19:15.980" style="s2">Treasury bought a lot<span style="s4"> of</span> stock on AIG</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.419" end="00:19:20.150" style="s2">Federal Reserve bought a lot<span style="s4"> of</span> bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.980" end="00:19:22.280" style="s2">assets from AIG so so we explained all</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.150" end="00:19:25.490" style="s2">that and one of these graphs is an</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.280" end="00:19:29.990" style="s2">example of the repayment progress of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.490" end="00:19:32.330" style="s2">federal assistance to AIG and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.990" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">example<span style="s4"> of</span> a useful<span style="s3"> metric</span> I think<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:32.330" end="00:19:36.590" style="s2">we provided Congress at least in May</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.330" style="s2">2012 we reported that Treasury would</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.590" end="00:19:40.100" style="s2">have had to sell its energy common stock</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.330" end="00:19:42.409" style="s2">for at least an average share price of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.100" end="00:19:46.070" style="s2">twenty nine dollars and seventy cents to</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.409" end="00:19:49.340" style="s2">fully recover its assistance so so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.070" end="00:19:53.539" style="s2">know if<span style="s3"> you</span> see here in early 2011</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.340" end="00:19:57.669" style="s2">Treasury own<span style="s3"> ninety two percent of AIG</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:53.539" end="00:20:01.070" style="s2">stock that&#39;s flat the last so eventually</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.669" end="00:20:05.020" style="s2"><span style="s3">Treasury</span> sold sold all<span style="s3"> its</span> AG stock at</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.070" end="00:20:07.700" style="s2">the end of 2012 but but again this</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.020" end="00:20:11.809" style="s2">putting<span style="s3"> these</span> measures together implied</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.700" end="00:20:13.610" style="s2">looking at a lot of AIG securities like</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.809" end="00:20:17.210" style="s2">SEC filings you know which are<span style="s3"> really</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:13.610" end="00:20:19.309" style="s2">big and we want to do that<span style="s3"> and</span> Federal</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.210" end="00:20:21.020" style="s2">Reserve would report on what of what</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.020" end="00:20:24.169" style="s2">their the valuation of<span style="s3"> the</span> assets they</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:26.870" style="s2">bought for example and<span style="s4"> then</span> Treasury</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.169" end="00:20:28.700" style="s2">would report on on the repayments to</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.870" end="00:20:29.480" style="s2">their line of credit for example so so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.700" end="00:20:31.540" style="s2">it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.480" end="00:20:35.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a<span style="s3"> nice</span> way<span style="s3"> to</span> just kind of</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.390" end="00:22:36.490" style="s2">would be<span style="s3"> up</span> to the team to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.520" end="00:22:38.780" style="s2">how to answer that particular question</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.490" end="00:22:41.780" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t<span style="s3"> think</span><span style="s4"> they&#39;re</span> restricted in</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.120" end="00:23:41.960" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> we<span style="s3"> measure</span> our progress is the the</p>

<p begin="00:23:46.730" end="00:23:50.810" style="s2">that&#39;s a goal that we said and<span style="s3"> we</span> very</p>

<p begin="00:23:53.150" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">implemented I can&#39;t say<span style="s3"> the</span> one hundred</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:23:59.960" style="s2">percent get implemented but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:02.450" style="s2">that&#39;s at least something that that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.960" end="00:24:05.870" style="s2">do try to track and we<span style="s3"> do</span> try to push to</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.450" end="00:24:07.370" style="s2">get those things taken care of I will</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.870" end="00:24:10.160" style="s2">say like it is interesting when you do</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.370" end="00:24:11.990" style="s2">see yourself get implemented so like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.160" end="00:24:14.870" style="s2">VA wait time stuff<span style="s3"> I</span> love using<span style="s3"> this</span></p>

<p begin="00:24:17.300" end="00:24:20.510" style="s2">mean<span style="s4"> there</span> the IG said it as well<span style="s4"> but</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:19.130" end="00:24:24.350" style="s2"><span style="s4">like</span> you know they did make changes to</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.510" end="00:24:26.330" style="s2">improve how they were collecting if</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.350" end="00:24:28.130" style="s2">somebody wanted to<span style="s3"> get</span> a study done or</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.330" end="00:24:30.500" style="s2">find out about<span style="s3"> something</span> they just call</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.500" end="00:24:34.130" style="s2">recipe you would<span style="s3"> Vegas</span> call your</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.120" end="00:24:36.860" style="s2">congressperson and they would request</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.470" end="00:24:46.520" style="s2">submit a request letter and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.810" end="00:24:47.540" style="s2">process<span style="s3"> to</span> kind of take in all of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.520" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">requests because we have limited</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.540" end="00:24:52.430" style="s2">resources and times like like other</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:54.620" style="s2">agencies and other organizations and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.430" end="00:24:56.660" style="s2">those get put into a prioritization and</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.660" end="00:25:00.380" style="s2">and the result are exceeding the reports</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:01.940" style="s2">that<span style="s3"> are</span> requested through mandates are</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.380" end="00:25:03.440" style="s2">things that often have a time limit so</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.940" end="00:25:06.550" style="s2"><span style="s4">those</span><span style="s3"> are</span> things we have to report on in</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.440" end="00:25:08.500" style="s2">a year or three years so those also<span style="s3"> have</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:06.550" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">more of a deadline<span style="s4"> and</span> prioritization</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.500" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">then push that was about for you so Kim</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:23.530" style="s2">journalist for<span style="s3"> the</span><span style="s4"> ga</span> so I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:25.090" style="s2">short answer is geo is not subject to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.530" end="00:25:29.050" style="s2">FOIA but we follow a<span style="s3"> four yo like</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:25.090" end="00:25:36.100" style="s2">process Freedom of Information Act yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.050" end="00:25:37.570" style="s2">I mean<span style="s4"> I</span> guess I don&#39;t really I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.100" end="00:25:39.280" style="s2">speak to the specifics of it right now i</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.570" end="00:25:41.860" style="s2">can give you so I mean it<span style="s3"> is</span> on our</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.280" end="00:25:43.690" style="s2">website kind of what that process is but</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.860" end="00:25:47.100" style="s2">it&#39;s similar in it tries to follow the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.690" end="00:25:49.420" style="s2">spirit of FOIA but we have a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.100" end="00:25:50.590" style="s2">the authorization in our creation is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.420" end="00:25:53.050" style="s2">little bit different so we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.590" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">subject to it directly like for<span style="s4"> example</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:53.050" end="00:25:57.310" style="s2">we use agency data we would I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:26:00.100" style="s2">direct them to bend that agency yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.310" end="00:26:03.070" style="s2">right yeah I<span style="s3"> mean</span> you saw in the reports</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.100" end="00:26:04.870" style="s2">we the agency data is our primary source</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.070" end="00:26:07.030" style="s2">well in<span style="s4"> my</span> experience that we use a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.870" end="00:26:13.080" style="s2">of agency data and a lot of that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.030" end="00:26:13.080" style="s2">public also but but<span style="s3"> it</span> is on the<span style="s4"> website</span></p>

<p begin="00:27:25.140" end="00:27:29.580" style="s2">there are different things<span style="s3"> we</span> can take</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.280" end="00:27:30.510" style="s2">into consideration and the managers on</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.580" end="00:27:32.190" style="s2">that particular team will then</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.510" end="00:27:34.050" style="s2">communicate that to the agency<span style="s4"> and</span> tell</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.190" end="00:27:36.660" style="s2">them what is maybe what they feel is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.050" end="00:27:39.720" style="s2">most incumbent upon them to implement</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.660" end="00:27:40.890" style="s2">yeah but<span style="s3"> like I said you know we set the</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:39.720" end="00:27:42.750" style="s2">bar of what percent we want to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.890" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">implemented and we we generally meet</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:48.090" style="s2"><span style="s3">really</span> struggling all the time to kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.040" end="00:27:51.260" style="s2">of to get there a lot<span style="s3"> of</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.090" end="00:27:51.260" style="s2">recommendations<span style="s3"> do</span> get implemented</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.409" end="00:28:08.989" style="s2">most of our reviews are retrospective<span style="s4"> I</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:05.059" end="00:28:10.219" style="s2"><span style="s4">would</span> say most many most of our reviews</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.989" end="00:28:13.340" style="s2">are retrospective you guys ever worked</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.219" end="00:28:15.109" style="s2">with<span style="s3"> real time yeah I mean</span> I i will say</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.340" end="00:28:16.969" style="s2">kind<span style="s3"> of</span> back when the Recovery<span style="s3"> Act</span> was</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.109" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">ongoing we had a mandate to<span style="s4"> review the a</span></p>

<p begin="00:28:20.359" end="00:28:26.690" style="s2">60 days and so in that case we were very</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:32.479" style="s2">there were a lot of requirements in laws</p>
