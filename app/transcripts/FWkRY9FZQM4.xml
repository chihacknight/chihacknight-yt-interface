<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:40.830" style="s2">but sidewalks are a really integral part</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.350" end="00:02:43.050" style="s2">of how we get to where we need to go but</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.830" end="00:02:46.380" style="s2">they&#39;re more<span style="s3"> than that to citizens who</span></p>

<p begin="00:02:46.380" end="00:02:50.460" style="s2">the things that enable those people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:53.160" style="s2">not only navigate the city but also<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:50.460" end="00:02:56.420" style="s2">use other forms of transportation so</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:38.730" style="s2">like<span style="s3"> everybody</span> else Luke&#39;s loves his</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.850" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">independence and he likes using public</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.730" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">transit in fact he started using public</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">transit about 15 years<span style="s4"> ago</span> and<span style="s3"> it</span> really</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:47.190" style="s2">opened up the world to him as public</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:50.790" style="s2">transit first of all provides the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.190" end="00:04:52.860" style="s2">flexibility for him and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.790" end="00:04:54.860" style="s2"><span style="s3">is</span><span style="s4"> that</span> he<span style="s4"> doesn&#39;t have to rely on</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:04:57.870" style="s2">anybody out so again his independence</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.860" end="00:05:00.770" style="s2">and so here he mentions the last mile</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.870" end="00:05:06.510" style="s2">was impossible so he had to take<span style="s3"> a</span> taxi</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.770" end="00:05:07.800" style="s2">so he still had once he takes the public</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.510" end="00:05:09.390" style="s2"><span style="s4">transportations</span> great and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.800" end="00:05:12.770" style="s2">providing with what he needs but he</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.390" end="00:05:15.150" style="s2">still has to plan how he&#39;s going to<span style="s3"> roll</span></p>
<p begin="00:05:12.770" end="00:05:17.130" style="s2">once he gets off of public</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.150" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2"><span style="s4">transportation</span> so now go back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.130" end="00:05:23.880" style="s2">sidewalks when sidewalks and curb cuts</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:26.190" style="s2">are in need of<span style="s4"> repair</span> they may have<span style="s3"> the</span></p>

<p begin="00:05:31.050" end="00:05:35.250" style="s2"><span style="s3">expected</span> a curb cut in good condition</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.870" end="00:09:33.530" style="s2">sidewalks that are pitched towards the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.250" end="00:09:35.270" style="s2">street so it looks<span style="s4"> like</span> there&#39;s a nice</p>

<p begin="00:10:02.280" end="00:10:08.850" style="s2">but it looks<span style="s4"> like</span><span style="s3"> this</span> kind of grew</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.680" end="00:10:13.110" style="s2">there and then here is one<span style="s4"> that</span> grew</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.850" end="00:10:15.060" style="s2">there so the the tree itself doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.110" end="00:10:17.850" style="s2">make it a navigable but you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.060" end="00:10:22.410" style="s2">space for the tree to<span style="s3"> grow</span> and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.850" end="00:10:26.670" style="s2">made this part in<span style="s3"> abbeville</span> this one was</p>

<p begin="00:10:26.670" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">cuts so there is a curb cut and there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.770" end="00:10:37.820" style="s2">a what do you call that a skid skid pad</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.200" end="00:10:37.820" style="s2">there what&#39;s late a detection plate I</p>

<p begin="00:10:56.130" end="00:11:03.450" style="s2">much curb cuts with a steep ramp I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.370" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">you get the picture here right so enter</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.760" end="00:11:19.620" style="s2"><span style="s3">okay</span> so shy safe path was a project<span style="s4"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:11:15.450" end="00:11:22.440" style="s2">started here at shy hack night and Steve</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.510" end="00:11:35.940" style="s2">show you how this worked as I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.300" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">before the city does want to help the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.940" end="00:11:40.650" style="s2">situation so it has to<span style="s4"> know about</span><span style="s3"> it</span> to</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.990" end="00:11:52.200" style="s2">by allowing a user to report a hazard</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.490" end="00:11:56.310" style="s2">the design is extremely simple you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.200" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">go to report on a hazard and then<span style="s3"> using</span></p>

<p begin="00:12:00.730" end="00:12:04.450" style="s2">right while you&#39;re there right it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.650" end="00:12:06.340" style="s2"><span style="s3">of like see click fix you could take a</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:04.450" end="00:12:07.900" style="s2">picture and later when you&#39;re in a more</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.340" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">convenient surrounding since the app</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.900" end="00:12:12.460" style="s2">captures the location the that the photo</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:34.450" style="s2">with bad sidewalks so<span style="s3"> I&#39;ll</span> go to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.330" end="00:12:36.300" style="s2">region here and I&#39;ll click on it and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.450" end="00:12:39.460" style="s2">can see there were three reports and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.300" end="00:12:43.510" style="s2">this goes gets it from the city data</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.460" end="00:12:45.070" style="s2">portal right<span style="s4"> okay</span> so what happens is<span style="s4"> is</span></p>

<p begin="00:12:45.070" end="00:12:48.640" style="s2"><span style="s3">then</span> it&#39;s in the data portal and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.350" end="00:12:50.710" style="s2">know if you can really see this<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:12:48.640" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">easily but it<span style="s3"> shows</span> you when it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.710" end="00:12:54.940" style="s2">created when it was updated and what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:58.990" style="s2">status is so a person managing a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.940" end="00:13:00.880" style="s2">disability now can go plan their trip</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.990" end="00:13:03.030" style="s2">and as they&#39;re planning their trip they</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.880" end="00:13:06.370" style="s2">can see the things that were open</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.030" end="00:13:08.530" style="s2"><span style="s3">ultimately</span> so this will<span style="s3"> save</span> them<span style="s3"> both</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:06.370" end="00:13:10.120" style="s2">time in serious injury ultimately what</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.530" end="00:13:13.720" style="s2">we want to do is we want<span style="s3"> to</span> have both</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.120" end="00:13:16.870" style="s2">311 data in there and crowd-sourced data</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.720" end="00:13:20.050" style="s2">and that crowdsource gate data to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.870" end="00:13:22.210" style="s2">into the 311 data so that appears right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.050" end="00:13:25.720" style="s2">away on the map and<span style="s3"> of</span><span style="s4"> course</span> it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.210" end="00:13:27.820" style="s2">better to have it in 311 because then</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.720" end="00:13:30.610" style="s2">you can track when it&#39;s fixed we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.820" end="00:13:32.680" style="s2">really<span style="s3"> figured</span> out how you do this thing</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.230" end="00:13:39.100" style="s2">something that will we have to<span style="s3"> think</span></p>

<p begin="00:17:59.030" end="00:18:19.290" style="s2">as a temporary yeah that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.980" end="00:18:21.059" style="s2">you say that so that&#39;s in<span style="s3"> Luke</span> says the</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.290" end="00:18:23.010" style="s2">more<span style="s3"> audience</span> we have the more we<span style="s4"> can</span> do</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.059" end="00:18:24.840" style="s2">so if something&#39;s gone away we can do it</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.010" end="00:18:27.300" style="s2">through<span style="s3"> crowd source but the other thing</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:24.840" end="00:18:32.850" style="s2">that he<span style="s3"> was</span> looking at doing was taking</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.300" end="00:18:37.170" style="s2">a look at building<span style="s4"> at</span> permits for<span style="s3"> street</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:32.850" end="00:18:40.230" style="s2">repair and seeing if he can correlate</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.170" end="00:18:42.150" style="s2">that as well that doesn&#39;t help you when</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.230" end="00:18:43.860" style="s2">when the when there&#39;s a crack in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.150" end="00:18:46.260" style="s2">street or something<span style="s3"> like</span> that but it</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.860" end="00:18:50.210" style="s2">does help<span style="s3"> you</span> in that very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.260" end="00:18:50.210" style="s2">time when the streets been scraped away</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:02.179" style="s2">it&#39;s a<span style="s3"> good idea</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:05.690" end="00:19:12.299" style="s2">what I was curious about<span style="s3"> was</span> how<span style="s4"> does</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:08.670" end="00:19:22.830" style="s2">ways do it so you report an accident at</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.299" end="00:19:25.020" style="s2">what<span style="s3"> point</span> does it clean that off really</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.830" end="00:19:26.520" style="s2">well that goes back<span style="s3"> to Steve&#39;s point the</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:25.020" end="00:19:29.480" style="s2">more<span style="s3"> audience</span> they have for it the more</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.520" end="00:19:29.480" style="s2">they can do yes sir</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:53.820" style="s2"><span style="s3">we&#39;re</span> talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.730" end="00:20:11.549" style="s2">Oh inside buildings yeah not initially</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:14.330" style="s2">one of the things<span style="s3"> Steve</span> has been<span style="s3"> doing</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:11.549" end="00:20:17.190" style="s2">has<span style="s4"> been</span> working with<span style="s3"> Karen</span> family the</p>

<p begin="00:20:20.250" end="00:20:24.780" style="s2">kind<span style="s3"> of</span> information can be made</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.040" end="00:20:27.260" style="s2">publicized and then what kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.780" end="00:20:30.570" style="s2">we<span style="s3"> can</span> do with it<span style="s3"> your</span> point<span style="s3"> about</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:27.260" end="00:20:32.910" style="s2">different equipment is<span style="s3"> spot on because</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:30.570" end="00:20:35.370" style="s2">we have three<span style="s4"> different</span> types of chairs</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.910" end="00:20:38.370" style="s2">in the room here<span style="s3"> theater</span> is managing</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.370" end="00:20:41.100" style="s2">with probably the lightest and could</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.370" end="00:20:44.640" style="s2">probably get down more things than Steve</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.100" end="00:20:47.910" style="s2">and then Pat&#39;s managing with a different</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.640" end="00:20:52.350" style="s2">type of chair<span style="s4"> altogether</span> that seems a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.910" end="00:20:55.049" style="s2">lot more nimble and a lot lighter but</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.350" end="00:21:03.590" style="s2">Steve&#39;s got equipment on his right<span style="s4"> so</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:55.049" end="00:21:03.590" style="s2">yes that&#39;s a<span style="s3"> great</span> idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:12.880" style="s2">great idea suggestion it&#39;s phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.120" end="00:21:15.130" style="s2">one is adding a severity level and<span style="s3"> maybe</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:12.880" end="00:21:32.430" style="s2">coming up with some criteria for how you</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.130" end="00:21:35.559" style="s2">rank that severity yeah<span style="s3"> Chris</span><span style="s4"> catch that</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:32.430" end="00:21:39.610" style="s2">that&#39;s a great<span style="s3"> one</span> the other thing I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.559" end="00:21:42.730" style="s2"><span style="s4">thinking about was could that be done</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:39.610" end="00:21:44.740" style="s2">using SMS text messaging as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.730" end="00:21:48.250" style="s2">this<span style="s3"> because</span> I was thinking about<span style="s3"> this</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:44.740" end="00:21:51.400" style="s2">stuff that M relief does and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.250" end="00:21:55.179" style="s2">how could that be applied to just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.400" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">different audience that&#39;s yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.179" end="00:21:59.760" style="s2">exactly yes sir</p>
