<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:52.820" style="s2">buildings so the<span style="s3"> city</span> has developed a</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">developed<span style="s4"> and</span> I believe in 2008 it has</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.280" end="00:02:06.320" style="s2">long-term goals for carbon reduction</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:08.729" style="s2">which you can see on the slide there</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.320" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">recently<span style="s4"> the</span> city released a report</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.729" end="00:02:13.110" style="s2">showing a seven percent reduction in</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">carbon emissions</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.110" end="00:02:17.340" style="s2">from 2010 2 2015 so we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:21.150" style="s2">progress as a city but we have a ways to</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.340" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">go more recently the city develop</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:24.960" style="s2">something called the sustainable<span style="s4"> Chicago</span></p>

<p begin="00:02:27.960" end="00:02:31.860" style="s2">identifies different themes and actions</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:34.850" style="s2">the city is<span style="s4"> going</span> to focus on to hit</p>

<p begin="00:02:34.850" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">and here&#39;s a quote from the mayor I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.190" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">say that<span style="s4"> the</span> takeaway from this slide is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:44.730" style="s2">really both of these documents<span style="s3"> and</span> a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:48.209" style="s2">of the city&#39;s work on sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.730" end="00:02:51.570" style="s2">focuses on energy and buildings because</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.209" end="00:02:54.390" style="s2"><span style="s4">it&#39;s</span><span style="s3"> a</span> huge<span style="s3"> opportunity</span> to both save</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.570" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">money and reduce emissions and clean up</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.390" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">our environment in Chicago carbon<span style="s3"> at</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:02.760" style="s2"><span style="s3">energy</span> used in<span style="s3"> building</span> so both</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:05.100" style="s2">electricity and natural gas make up a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.760" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2"><span style="s3">little</span> over seventy percent<span style="s3"> of</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.100" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">city&#39;s total carbon emissions so if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:12.090" style="s2"><span style="s3">don&#39;t</span> address this it will never<span style="s3"> hit</span> any</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:13.890" style="s2"><span style="s3">long-term</span> carbon reduction goals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.090" end="00:03:15.390" style="s2">it&#39;s been a huge focus<span style="s3"> of</span> the</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.390" end="00:03:21.269" style="s2">while<span style="s4"> now</span> so that&#39;s why the<span style="s3"> city</span> cares</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.600" end="00:03:25.019" style="s2">about energy efficiency what is the city</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.269" end="00:03:27.510" style="s2">doing so the goal is let&#39;s accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.019" end="00:03:29.670" style="s2">what&#39;s happening a lot of work has<span style="s4"> been</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:27.510" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">happening<span style="s4"> in</span><span style="s3"> this</span> field some of<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="00:03:29.670" end="00:03:34.769" style="s2">driven<span style="s3"> by</span> the state level the utilities</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:36.510" style="s2">both have energy efficiency programs</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.769" end="00:03:40.170" style="s2">where<span style="s4"> they</span> have rebates and incentives</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.510" end="00:03:42.600" style="s2">for different types of energy efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.170" end="00:03:44.130" style="s2">actions but when the city thinks about</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.600" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">it I think<span style="s3"> we</span> kind of divide things into</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.130" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">both voluntary programs and the code</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:56.220" style="s2">which is mandatory so for for mandatory</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:57.420" style="s2">things we we have<span style="s3"> this</span> benchmarking</p>

<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:09.540" style="s2">the voluntary side we have something</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.510" end="00:04:10.829" style="s2"><span style="s4">called</span> retrofit Chicago so I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:13.019" style="s2">today about<span style="s3"> the</span> building energy</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.829" end="00:04:15.420" style="s2">transparency if you&#39;re curious<span style="s4"> about</span></p>

<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">the city passed this ordinance back in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.930" end="00:04:26.150" style="s2">2013 it really seeks to raise<span style="s4"> awareness</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:28.070" style="s2">of energy performance</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.150" end="00:04:31.729" style="s2">through<span style="s3"> information</span> and<span style="s3"> transparency</span> it</p>

<p begin="00:04:35.750" end="00:04:39.949" style="s2"><span style="s3">have</span> to do anything if their efficiency</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.570" end="00:05:45.860" style="s2">buildings and their owners or property</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.510" end="00:05:51.940" style="s2">managers have to do so we phased this in</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.860" end="00:05:54.710" style="s2">overtime and basically as I mentioned we</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.940" end="00:05:57.740" style="s2"><span style="s3">it</span> was a three-year phase-in period so</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.710" end="00:05:59.389" style="s2"><span style="s4">we</span> started in 2014 not very many</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.740" end="00:06:01.820" style="s2">buildings just commercial or</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.389" end="00:06:04.909" style="s2">institutional buildings 250,000 square</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.820" end="00:06:07.580" style="s2">feet and greater and as you can see in</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.909" end="00:06:10.580" style="s2">2015 and 2016 we brought in more</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.580" end="00:06:13.220" style="s2">buildings so the light blue bars show</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.580" end="00:06:16.550" style="s2">when you have to do the benchmarking and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.220" end="00:06:17.620" style="s2">reporting and the<span style="s3"> red Chicago star is</span></p>
<p begin="00:06:16.550" end="00:06:21.409" style="s2">when you had to do the data verification</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.620" end="00:06:23.330" style="s2">so now everyone&#39;s been phased in as of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.409" end="00:06:28.250" style="s2">the end of last year and we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.330" end="00:06:30.169" style="s2"><span style="s3">that cycle over this year and 2017 we</span></p>
<p begin="00:06:28.250" end="00:06:32.090" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t<span style="s3"> be</span> a very good data or</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.169" end="00:06:34.700" style="s2">transparency ordinance without some data</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.090" end="00:06:38.409" style="s2">so this<span style="s3"> is</span> what compliance has looked</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.700" end="00:06:38.409" style="s2">like over the past four<span style="s4"> years</span></p>
<p begin="00:06:38.470" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">so as I mentioned 2014 with a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.180" end="00:06:43.300" style="s2">small year we had less<span style="s4"> than</span><span style="s3"> 300</span></p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:45.820" style="s2">buildings that were required<span style="s3"> to</span> do</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.820" end="00:06:51.700" style="s2">over<span style="s4"> 3,500</span> and that should remain pretty</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.280" end="00:06:55.630" style="s2">steady going forward<span style="s3"> you</span> can see the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.700" end="00:06:57.610" style="s2">compliance rate by number<span style="s3"> of</span> properties</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.630" end="00:06:59.500" style="s2">has<span style="s4"> been</span> in the eighty to ninety percent</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.610" end="00:07:01.300" style="s2">range and when you measure<span style="s4"> that</span> by</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.500" end="00:07:06.910" style="s2">square footage is consistently over</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.910" end="00:07:12.220" style="s2">a<span style="s3"> little more about the results we&#39;ve</span></p>

<p begin="00:07:57.760" end="00:08:01.570" style="s2">tend to have a little<span style="s3"> bit</span> more of<span style="s4"> these</span></p>

<p begin="00:08:03.910" end="00:08:08.350" style="s2">little bit less dense and have not as</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.340" end="00:08:16.120" style="s2">many big buildings so you&#39;ll see a</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.350" end="00:08:18.580" style="s2">little bit fewer numbers there so as I</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.120" end="00:08:20.290" style="s2">mentioned the second year<span style="s3"> of</span> building</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.580" end="00:08:21.970" style="s2">reports the city&#39;s authorized to share</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.290" end="00:08:24.100" style="s2">their data the first year is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.970" end="00:08:26.020" style="s2">grace period so if you&#39;re<span style="s4"> building</span> sucks</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.100" end="00:08:28.570" style="s2">you can do something<span style="s3"> about</span> it and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.020" end="00:08:30.970" style="s2">of the next year you report and the city</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.570" end="00:08:33.580" style="s2">will release your data at that point so</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.970" end="00:08:36.969" style="s2">we&#39;ve released two data sets on the<span style="s3"> data</span></p>

<p begin="00:08:39.330" end="00:08:46.030" style="s2">and so there&#39;s two things up there one</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.380" end="00:08:49.540" style="s2">is just<span style="s3"> the</span> full list of every building</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.030" end="00:08:51.690" style="s2">required to comply and then the second</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.540" end="00:08:56.400" style="s2">is the results from the building</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.690" end="00:08:58.200" style="s2">it complies we also created a map this</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.200" end="00:09:02.900" style="s2">helped to create you can<span style="s3"> create your own</span></p>
<p begin="00:09:01.100" end="00:09:06.420" style="s2">it&#39;s meant to be a data visualization</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.900" end="00:09:08.520" style="s2">you can create<span style="s3"> your</span> own comparisons you</p>

<p begin="00:09:08.520" end="00:09:12.180" style="s2">both of<span style="s3"> these</span> are linked on that mean</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:23.010" style="s2">building<span style="s4"> like</span> this one what kind of data</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:24.380" style="s2">can you find out so there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.010" end="00:09:26.730" style="s2"><span style="s3">different</span> categories<span style="s3"> of</span> information</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.730" end="00:09:32.580" style="s2">that&#39;s complied for at least two years</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.870" end="00:09:35.660" style="s2">so there&#39;s basic building information</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.580" end="00:09:37.860" style="s2">like the address square<span style="s4"> footage</span> etc</p>

<p begin="00:09:37.860" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">probably the key part of<span style="s4"> the</span> report so</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.850" end="00:09:45.540" style="s2">energy use per square foot measures in a</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.770" end="00:18:49.270" style="s2">higher score yeah they get an email that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.440" end="00:18:51.340" style="s2">has that but we are going to work<span style="s4"> with</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.270" end="00:18:53.110" style="s2">partner to do a pilot this year to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.340" end="00:18:55.630" style="s2">just<span style="s3"> that</span> so we&#39;re going<span style="s3"> to</span> try to<span style="s4"> ten</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:53.110" end="00:18:57.220" style="s2"><span style="s4">point</span> buildings with low scores maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.630" end="00:18:59.770" style="s2">some of them<span style="s3"> are</span> going to be nonprofits</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.220" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">or houses of worship<span style="s3"> or</span> buildings with</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.770" end="00:19:03.160" style="s2">financial needs so that we can reach out</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:05.350" style="s2"><span style="s3">to</span><span style="s4"> them and ask and offer them some</span></p>

<p begin="00:19:05.350" end="00:19:08.530" style="s2">that this year and see how it goes<span style="s3"> we&#39;re</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:07.090" end="00:19:10.770" style="s2">going to do a pilot hopefully with</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.530" end="00:19:13.630" style="s2">somewhere in the range of 50 buildings</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.770" end="00:19:15.100" style="s2">to get enrolled but I think<span style="s3"> that&#39;s</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.630" end="00:19:17.110" style="s2">huge opportunity and we&#39;d<span style="s4"> have</span> to<span style="s4"> work</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:15.100" end="00:19:19.570" style="s2">with a lot of other nonprofits in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.110" end="00:19:21.730" style="s2">area to<span style="s3"> get</span> that done for sure<span style="s4"> cool</span><span style="s3"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:19.570" end="00:19:25.780" style="s2">then my second question is if you<span style="s3"> had</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:21.730" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">unlimited resources what&#39;s one is there</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.780" end="00:19:32.680" style="s2">something that you would<span style="s4"> like</span> really</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:39.850" style="s2"><span style="s3">want</span> to do with<span style="s4"> this</span> hmm that&#39;s a<span style="s3"> great</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:32.680" end="00:19:41.680" style="s2">question<span style="s4"> I</span> think if the if if we had</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.850" end="00:19:45.460" style="s2">unlimited resources I would think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.680" end="00:19:46.630" style="s2">and the folks at City Hall<span style="s3"> maybe</span> don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.460" end="00:19:49.510" style="s2">tell them this I would<span style="s3"> think about</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:46.630" end="00:19:51.670" style="s2">lowering the threshold to below 50,000</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.510" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">square feet New York City<span style="s3"> just did that</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:51.670" end="00:19:56.590" style="s2">they require any building now 25,000</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:57.970" style="s2">square feet<span style="s3"> and</span> up to comply and I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.590" end="00:20:00.220" style="s2"><span style="s4">in</span> New York that&#39;s<span style="s3"> an</span> extra seven or</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.970" end="00:20:01.420" style="s2">eight thousand buildings so getting some</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.220" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">of the smaller buildings involved in</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.420" end="00:20:05.680" style="s2">this it&#39;s a<span style="s3"> little bit harder though</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:07.810" style="s2">because those buildings don&#39;t<span style="s3"> have</span> as</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.680" end="00:20:10.150" style="s2">much resources to<span style="s3"> do</span> the benchmarking</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.810" end="00:20:13.500" style="s2">and to do the energy work so they need a</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.150" end="00:20:13.500" style="s2">lot more hand-holding to get it done</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.710" end="00:20:20.260" style="s2">right<span style="s3"> here</span> okay I&#39;m<span style="s3"> kind</span> of curious</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">first of all I think<span style="s3"> it&#39;s great project</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:20.260" end="00:20:24.040" style="s2">and<span style="s3"> I</span> appreciate the data being</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.760" end="00:20:29.410" style="s2">the data portal as well<span style="s3"> I&#39;m</span> curious as</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.040" end="00:20:31.450" style="s2"><span style="s3">to</span> like the sort of organizational where</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.410" end="00:20:32.680" style="s2">the funding for this came from like I</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.450" end="00:20:34.750" style="s2"><span style="s4">noticed</span><span style="s3"> it&#39;s</span> a<span style="s3"> partnership</span> with City</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.680" end="00:20:37.570" style="s2">energy i wonder if you explain what city</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.750" end="00:20:39.730" style="s2">energy is and how that&#39;s funded and how</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.570" end="00:20:41.710" style="s2">when you talk about these like reporting</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.730" end="00:20:44.440" style="s2">requirements is<span style="s4"> that</span> being required by</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.710" end="00:20:49.480" style="s2">the people who are funding this or is<span style="s4"> it</span></p>

<p begin="00:23:38.269" end="00:23:44.049" style="s2">technically it&#39;s the<span style="s4"> building</span> owner or</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.970" end="00:23:46.460" style="s2">that person&#39;s agent or building manager</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.049" end="00:23:48.919" style="s2">tenants don&#39;t typically have much to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.460" end="00:23:50.179" style="s2">with this so the<span style="s3"> data</span> comes<span style="s3"> from</span> the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.919" end="00:23:51.529" style="s2">utility so you don&#39;t have<span style="s3"> to</span> go to your</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.179" end="00:23:53.809" style="s2">tenants and get data from them or</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.529" end="00:23:55.399" style="s2">anything if a building is doing really</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.809" end="00:23:57.500" style="s2">well in terms of their energy</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.399" end="00:23:58.490" style="s2">performance it probably depends to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.500" end="00:24:00.289" style="s2"><span style="s3">answer that question you&#39;d have to look</span></p>
<p begin="00:23:58.490" end="00:24:02.210" style="s2">at<span style="s3"> what kind of building</span> it is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.289" end="00:24:04.460" style="s2">building<span style="s3"> like</span> this they&#39;ve actually done</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.210" end="00:24:06.230" style="s2">a lot in<span style="s3"> the</span><span style="s4"> merchandize</span> mart to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.460" end="00:24:08.059" style="s2">the space is more efficient so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.230" end="00:24:11.539" style="s2">the ownership usually working with</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.059" end="00:24:14.210" style="s2">property management but in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.539" end="00:24:16.639" style="s2"><span style="s4">you</span> will need to<span style="s4"> work</span> with tenants to</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.210" end="00:24:18.409" style="s2">get them to do things as well so to<span style="s3"> get</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:16.639" end="00:24:20.149" style="s2">a really high score tenants probably had</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.409" end="00:24:21.830" style="s2">been involved at some point in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.149" end="00:24:26.500" style="s2">building<span style="s4"> like</span> this or an office<span style="s3"> building</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:21.830" end="00:24:28.519" style="s2"><span style="s3">or</span> a condo building so it really<span style="s3"> depends</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:26.500" end="00:24:34.190" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry<span style="s4"> that</span> probably wasn&#39;t a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.519" end="00:24:36.669" style="s2">satisfying answer but yeah sure all</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.190" end="00:24:36.669" style="s2">right here</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.380" end="00:24:44.590" style="s2">hi thanks<span style="s4"> for</span> the presentation really</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:46.840" style="s2">informative do you think that one of<span style="s3"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:44.590" end="00:24:49.150" style="s2">speed bumps that especially smaller</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.840" end="00:24:51.670" style="s2">buildings have to adopt these energy</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.150" end="00:24:53.680" style="s2">measures is the cost so I know<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:51.670" end="00:24:55.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot<span style="s4"> of</span> information<span style="s3"> on</span> you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.680" end="00:24:57.340" style="s2">emissions and stuff like that but<span style="s3"> you</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:55.660" end="00:24:59.980" style="s2"><span style="s4">know</span> the direct<span style="s4"> cost</span><span style="s3"> and</span> you guys<span style="s4"> helped</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:57.340" end="00:25:02.710" style="s2">kind of debunk some of the myths towards</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.980" end="00:25:04.630" style="s2">that it&#39;s a<span style="s3"> great</span> question we we</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.710" end="00:25:07.720" style="s2">constantly ask ourselves why aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.630" end="00:25:10.330" style="s2">people doing more of this it seems easy</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.720" end="00:25:13.300" style="s2">and and some of the easier things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.330" end="00:25:14.800" style="s2">cost that much<span style="s3"> I</span> think it again it</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.300" end="00:25:16.360" style="s2">depends probably one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.800" end="00:25:19.150" style="s2"><span style="s3">barriers</span> it&#39;s just lack of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.360" end="00:25:21.160" style="s2">lack of information not only about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.150" end="00:25:23.920" style="s2">building&#39;s energy performance which<span style="s3"> this</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:21.160" end="00:25:26.170" style="s2">obviously helps fix that but about you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.920" end="00:25:28.510" style="s2">know what you can do to start taking</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.170" end="00:25:31.780" style="s2"><span style="s3">action</span> so<span style="s3"> if</span> you get a score of 30 you</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.510" end="00:25:34.360" style="s2">might not know really what to do as I</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.780" end="00:25:36.520" style="s2"><span style="s3">mentioned</span> both utilities offer rebate</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.360" end="00:25:38.200" style="s2">and incentive programs in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.520" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll come and change<span style="s3"> all</span> your light</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.200" end="00:25:42.460" style="s2"><span style="s4">bulbs</span> for like no cost I think there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">still some programs they both comment</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.460" end="00:25:47.860" style="s2">that comment provides<span style="s4"> but</span> people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:50.110" style="s2">know that much about them so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.860" end="00:25:52.780" style="s2"><span style="s3">find</span> out about those programs and enroll</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.110" end="00:25:54.580" style="s2">and have a little bit of knowledge to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.780" end="00:25:58.900" style="s2">get it<span style="s3"> done</span> so<span style="s4"> we</span> think<span style="s3"> there&#39;s just</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:54.580" end="00:26:00.990" style="s2">still some education needs to happen for</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.900" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">a bigger upgrades coughs<span style="s4"> cambian</span> issue</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.990" end="00:26:05.560" style="s2">and it depends on the building type</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:09.130" style="s2">again a non-profit might have a harder</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.560" end="00:26:12.700" style="s2">time than a big skyscraper in the loop</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.130" end="00:26:16.140" style="s2">so so I think<span style="s3"> cost</span> can be an issue</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.700" end="00:26:21.180" style="s2">depending on the building type as<span style="s4"> well</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:16.140" end="00:26:21.180" style="s2"><span style="s3">is that it</span> all right<span style="s4"> thank</span></p>
