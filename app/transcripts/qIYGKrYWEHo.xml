<p begin="00:02:16.440" end="00:02:21.600" style="s2">but by the time they got down to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.660" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">judges they just they stopped they gave</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.600" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">up and this case in particular this</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:37.320" style="s2">judge Annie O&#39;Donnell so many of you may</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">know about<span style="s3"> Bar Association ratings they</span></p>
<p begin="00:02:37.320" end="00:02:43.770" style="s2">do a lot<span style="s4"> of</span> work to rate to all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:45.510" style="s2">judicial candidates they it&#39;s an hour</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.770" end="00:02:48.390" style="s2">and<span style="s4"> a</span> half long interview they asked for</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.510" end="00:02:50.790" style="s2"><span style="s4">20</span> references they go through their</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.390" end="00:02:54.780" style="s2">court filings and they come out with</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.790" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2">things like<span style="s4"> okay</span> this judge was she was</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.780" end="00:02:59.210" style="s2">not recommended by any bar association</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:02.570" style="s2">she was actively not recommended and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.210" end="00:03:06.300" style="s2">they said she had an abuse of practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.570" end="00:03:07.710" style="s2">unduly flip and rude<span style="s3"> okay</span> which is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.300" end="00:03:09.090" style="s2">the<span style="s3"> worst</span> thing<span style="s3"> you</span> could do there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.710" end="00:03:15.360" style="s2">another judge who actually assaulted</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.090" end="00:03:18.180" style="s2">someone in her courtroom no judicial</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.360" end="00:03:26.630" style="s2">retention judge has not been retained</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.180" end="00:03:34.290" style="s2">since 1990 so we need help<span style="s3"> here</span> right</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.630" end="00:03:36.510" style="s2">okay so some judges can either be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.290" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">either a contested race or it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.510" end="00:03:43.770" style="s2">they&#39;re reelected to keep their job does</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">that make sense question<span style="s4"> okay</span> so in for</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.770" end="00:03:49.050" style="s2">all the judges where they keep their job</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">just by an election they&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.050" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">retained in that job since 1990 and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:04:00.570" style="s2">maybe this can be the<span style="s3"> year</span> where a judge</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:04.470" style="s2">is kicked out yes so the the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.570" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">for people<span style="s4"> that</span> like people<span style="s3"> are</span> looking</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.820" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">but we&#39;ve gotten feedback that it would</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.650" end="00:17:49.570" style="s2">be super useful so we&#39;re going to add it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:53.410" style="s2">the one thing that kind of helps you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.570" end="00:17:55.780" style="s2">a sense is the stances the the issues so</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.410" end="00:17:57.700" style="s2">you<span style="s3"> can</span><span style="s4"> like</span> click<span style="s3"> these</span> and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.780" end="00:18:01.060" style="s2">compare candidates by the issue that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.700" end="00:18:05.320" style="s2">care about so<span style="s3"> like laQuan McDonald</span> or</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.060" end="00:18:10.030" style="s2">diversity<span style="s3"> and</span><span style="s4"> the</span> issues are different</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.320" end="00:18:11.560" style="s2">for every race so the the presidential</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.030" end="00:18:17.820" style="s2">candidates are not going to have laQuan</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.560" end="00:18:17.820" style="s2">McDonald yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.190" end="00:18:53.289" style="s2"><span style="s3">okay</span> so right now we go after<span style="s3"> people</span> who</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.070" end="00:18:56.630" style="s2">are already likely to vote and we so</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.289" end="00:18:59.269" style="s2">before this we did this voter behavior</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.630" end="00:19:02.929" style="s2">research we talked to over 150 voters</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.269" end="00:19:06.110" style="s2">some of whom we found that<span style="s3"> oh</span> what was</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.929" end="00:19:09.230" style="s2">then open gov at this event literally</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.110" end="00:19:10.970" style="s2">everyone we<span style="s3"> talked</span><span style="s4"> to</span> admitted to either</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.230" end="00:19:14.690" style="s2">not completing their ballot or guessing</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.970" end="00:19:24.380" style="s2">so our kind of theory hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.690" end="00:19:26.919" style="s2">everyone is uninformed essentially<span style="s3"> you</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:24.380" end="00:19:26.919" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.910" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2"><span style="s3">what</span> is there are you using technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.730" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">and some way that you&#39;re doing<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:57.100" style="s2"><span style="s3">process</span> that better than yeah um it&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:20:00.340" style="s2"><span style="s4">actually</span> don&#39;t need the skill of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.100" end="00:20:02.250" style="s2">journalist because we&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.340" end="00:20:06.490" style="s2">information like where did this</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.250" end="00:20:08.830" style="s2">candidate grow up tell us what stances</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.490" end="00:20:12.370" style="s2">this candidate has and they&#39;re taking<span style="s4"> it</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:08.830" end="00:20:17.700" style="s2">like in the same words that like as the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.370" end="00:20:21.370" style="s2">candidate says on their website so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.700" end="00:20:23.560" style="s2">does<span style="s3"> that</span><span style="s4"> answer that question it we</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:21.370" end="00:20:25.690" style="s2"><span style="s3">don&#39;t</span> it&#39;s similar to what journalists</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.560" end="00:20:28.420" style="s2">do but also we&#39;re working on automation</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.690" end="00:20:31.750" style="s2">efforts so like one thing we do is we</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.420" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">tag every issue every stance with<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:31.750" end="00:20:38.890" style="s2">issue that it&#39;s relevant to so if i say</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:42.370" style="s2">candidate a supports funding high</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.890" end="00:20:44.710" style="s2">schools we<span style="s3"> tag</span> that with budget and k-12</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.370" end="00:20:48.600" style="s2">education that we&#39;re trying<span style="s3"> to</span> automate</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.710" end="00:20:53.590" style="s2">that so it&#39;s not less biased and faster</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.600" end="00:20:54.760" style="s2">yeah yeah is there a function<span style="s4"> I</span> can</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.590" end="00:20:57.240" style="s2">select<span style="s3"> every</span> what I want to vote for</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.760" end="00:21:02.860" style="s2">email to myself</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.860" end="00:21:07.480" style="s2">not have<span style="s4"> a</span> nap because<span style="s3"> we</span> thought<span style="s4"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:10.690" style="s2">people<span style="s3"> wouldn&#39;t</span> want<span style="s3"> to</span> take the<span style="s4"> time</span> to</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.480" end="00:21:12.490" style="s2">download it but we&#39;ve gotten some fee</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.690" end="00:21:16.990" style="s2">but we might change<span style="s3"> your</span> mind about that</p>
