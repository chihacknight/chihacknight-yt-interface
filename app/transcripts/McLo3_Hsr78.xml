<p begin="00:04:02.459" end="00:04:07.319" style="s2">of the ways that we do that is through a</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.950" end="00:04:34.430" style="s2"><span style="s4">livin</span> so we want<span style="s4"> to</span> do that<span style="s4"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:36.380" style="s2">accomplish three specific purposes one</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.430" end="00:04:38.510" style="s2">is to empower the next generation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.380" end="00:04:41.000" style="s2"><span style="s3">Latino</span> techies so we had the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.510" end="00:04:43.970" style="s2">bilingual tech days in Chicago where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.000" end="00:04:48.170" style="s2">had different activities to teach kids</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.970" end="00:04:52.280" style="s2">how to code we had vegan activities with</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.170" end="00:04:55.460" style="s2">VR devices we had kids<span style="s3"> working</span> with</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.280" end="00:04:57.740" style="s2">electrical circuits we did a few of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.460" end="00:05:00.260" style="s2">those in<span style="s4"> Pilsen</span> and we also were at the</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.260" end="00:05:05.240" style="s2">at Chicago geek street so another thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.650" end="00:05:08.450" style="s2">that&#39;s important to<span style="s4"> us</span> is connecting</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.240" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">Latinos across tech so for<span style="s3"> example</span> we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.450" end="00:05:13.070" style="s2">had some meetups and we also had the ola</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:14.870" style="s2">google group of Latino employees over at</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.070" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">Google come and talk<span style="s3"> about their</span></p>

<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:24.110" style="s2">and what those experiences are like and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.190" end="00:05:26.450" style="s2"><span style="s3">then</span> another major goal<span style="s4"> of</span> ours is<span style="s3"> to</span></p>
<p begin="00:05:24.110" end="00:05:29.630" style="s2">tackle community issues through</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.450" end="00:05:31.990" style="s2">technology and we do that through our</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.820" end="00:12:32.020" style="s2">start to find who the main investors are</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.620" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">in that corporation you can see what</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.890" end="00:13:38.280" style="s2">be very<span style="s4"> effective</span> with the information</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.210" end="00:13:40.830" style="s2"><span style="s4">that</span> we collect so yeah all<span style="s4"> of</span><span style="s3"> this</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:38.280" end="00:13:42.360" style="s2">information is available online but<span style="s4"> the</span></p>
<p begin="00:13:40.830" end="00:13:44.190" style="s2"><span style="s3">problem</span> is<span style="s4"> that</span> it&#39;s<span style="s3"> kind</span> of difficult</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.190" end="00:13:47.910" style="s2"><span style="s3">and</span> clunky they&#39;re difficult<span style="s3"> to</span> navigate</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.020" end="00:13:49.860" style="s2">and a lot of<span style="s3"> them</span> require specialized</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.910" end="00:13:51.390" style="s2">knowledge to access it so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.860" end="00:13:52.410" style="s2">know what you&#39;re<span style="s4"> looking</span> for you have to</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.410" end="00:13:56.580" style="s2"><span style="s4">oftentimes</span><span style="s3"> you</span> have<span style="s3"> to</span> reference</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.520" end="00:13:58.050" style="s2">different websites to get to get the</p>

<p begin="00:13:58.050" end="00:14:01.530" style="s2">piece of information and go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.610" end="00:14:03.930" style="s2">original<span style="s4"> website</span> so it&#39;s a tedious</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.530" end="00:14:07.590" style="s2">process it takes what is it hours you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.930" end="00:14:12.150" style="s2">guys say yeah it took days to find it<span style="s4"> so</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:07.590" end="00:14:14.310" style="s2">what we good next time what<span style="s3"> really</span> we</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.150" end="00:14:16.590" style="s2">wanted<span style="s4"> to</span> do in this hackathon was to</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.310" end="00:14:19.230" style="s2">build a website that makes finding that</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.590" end="00:14:20.760" style="s2">easier originally our goal was to build</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.230" end="00:14:22.680" style="s2"><span style="s3">an</span> automated workflow that got all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.760" end="00:14:24.300" style="s2">websites to talk to each<span style="s3"> other</span> that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.680" end="00:14:26.040" style="s2">a little bit too<span style="s3"> large</span> for the<span style="s3"> scope</span> we</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.300" end="00:14:28.020" style="s2">after we kind of settled on what we were</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.040" end="00:14:29.910" style="s2">going to do and figuring out what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.020" end="00:14:32.790" style="s2"><span style="s3">websites</span> were we only had about six</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.910" end="00:14:35.460" style="s2">hours so we built this step-by-step</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.790" end="00:14:38.430" style="s2">website that&#39;s a lot more tedious but it</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.460" end="00:14:40.260" style="s2">walks you through how to like what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.430" end="00:14:41.610" style="s2">want you<span style="s3"> can</span> pop it over here email it</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.260" end="00:14:44.100" style="s2">to yourself<span style="s3"> and</span> then it has little</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.610" end="00:14:45.720" style="s2"><span style="s3">information</span> bubbles like why do you need</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.100" end="00:14:48.150" style="s2"><span style="s3">to know the pin number what</span><span style="s4"> is</span> the pin</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.720" end="00:14:50.190" style="s2">number why do you need<span style="s3"> to know this so</span></p>
<p begin="00:14:48.150" end="00:14:51.450" style="s2">that&#39;s what we ended up doing but we</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.190" end="00:14:53.820" style="s2">want<span style="s3"> to talk</span><span style="s4"> about</span> what we want<span style="s4"> to</span> do</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.450" end="00:14:56.250" style="s2">going forward yeah so the next step</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.820" end="00:14:58.200" style="s2">would be to actually finish that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.250" end="00:14:59.160" style="s2">worksheet website and actually make it</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.200" end="00:15:01.500" style="s2">more functional because unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.160" end="00:15:04.710" style="s2">during the day we were only able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.500" end="00:15:07.820" style="s2"><span style="s3">complete</span> a few of those steps<span style="s4"> to</span> run</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.710" end="00:15:09.810" style="s2"><span style="s3">through</span> the whole process so and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.820" end="00:15:11.400" style="s2">since then we&#39;ve been working on getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.810" end="00:15:14.730" style="s2">some more of that information together</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.400" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">but we really<span style="s4"> need</span> to<span style="s3"> kind</span> of finish</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.730" end="00:15:19.890" style="s2">that up and you can go to the<span style="s4"> next</span> one</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:23.250" style="s2"><span style="s3">and</span> then<span style="s3"> this is kind of like a mock-up</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:19.890" end="00:15:25.200" style="s2">of what it could look like but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.250" end="00:15:29.790" style="s2">actually thinking<span style="s3"> that</span><span style="s4"> we</span> would need</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.200" end="00:15:33.570" style="s2">some<span style="s3"> more</span> user interface design and more</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.790" end="00:15:34.670" style="s2">of this functionality the tube to<span style="s3"> work</span></p>
<p begin="00:15:33.570" end="00:15:37.850" style="s2">and to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.670" end="00:15:40.100" style="s2">an email the worksheet and then<span style="s3"> kind</span> of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.850" end="00:15:42.170" style="s2">beef up that information section would</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.100" end="00:15:45.590" style="s2">be the next goal and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.170" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2"><span style="s4">another</span> website we want to build hello</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.590" end="00:15:49.550" style="s2">100 again so I work for here maps that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:51.740" style="s2">I&#39;m a sovereign developer making big</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.550" end="00:15:53.870" style="s2">data pipelines so when I saw this</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.740" end="00:15:55.610" style="s2">problem number one it kind of struck a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.870" end="00:15:56.780" style="s2">chord because I always<span style="s3"> see</span> new buildings</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.610" end="00:15:58.340" style="s2">coming up all over Chicago and have</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.780" end="00:15:59.720" style="s2">mixed feelings about<span style="s3"> it</span> number two I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.340" end="00:16:01.280" style="s2">feel like my skills could<span style="s4"> be</span> applied to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.720" end="00:16:02.960" style="s2">this problem so<span style="s4"> what I wanted to do is</span></p>
<p begin="00:16:01.280" end="00:16:05.030" style="s2">basically build an entire workflow for</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.960" end="00:16:06.500" style="s2">so someone like no it doesn&#39;t have to go</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.030" end="00:16:08.120" style="s2">to a billion websites and collect all</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.500" end="00:16:09.530" style="s2">those information for one click<span style="s3"> of</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.120" end="00:16:11.240" style="s2">button you should be able to get all</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.530" end="00:16:13.280" style="s2">this information from Tennessee easily</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.240" end="00:16:15.860" style="s2">so it ended up being a very ambitious</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.280" end="00:16:18.830" style="s2">goal we weren&#39;t able<span style="s3"> to</span> even begin it</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.860" end="00:16:20.540" style="s2">the<span style="s3"> biggest reason is</span> most of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.830" end="00:16:22.130" style="s2">websites don&#39;t actually have rest api s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.540" end="00:16:24.140" style="s2">so it&#39;s not easy to actually write a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.130" end="00:16:26.500" style="s2">script to have all this be automated</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.140" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">there are workarounds of creating a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.500" end="00:16:31.010" style="s2">scraper web scraper<span style="s3"> my</span> web developer so</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:34.730" style="s2">much sure that&#39;s an option but we need</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.010" end="00:16:37.190" style="s2">more web development up to that yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.730" end="00:16:39.410" style="s2">in the end once we<span style="s3"> have</span> this work will</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.190" end="00:16:40.730" style="s2">actually created with still our goal you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.410" end="00:16:42.770" style="s2"><span style="s4">have</span> something like<span style="s4"> this</span><span style="s3"> where you put</span></p>
<p begin="00:16:40.730" end="00:16:45.620" style="s2">in something like an address<span style="s3"> or</span> renters</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.770" end="00:16:47.210" style="s2">or landlords name and all those data</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.620" end="00:16:52.250" style="s2">point to be popped up that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.210" end="00:16:53.420" style="s2">long-term ambitious goal cool thank you</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.250" end="00:16:58.169" style="s2">very much</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.870" end="00:18:14.500" style="s2">know tenants are not in a good situation</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.220" end="00:18:17.050" style="s2">in chicago<span style="s3"> even</span> though there are some</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.500" end="00:18:18.610" style="s2">really strong tenant laws here but if</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.050" end="00:18:20.830" style="s2">you don&#39;t know about<span style="s3"> them</span> then what are</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.610" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">you going<span style="s3"> to</span> do yeah that&#39;s a<span style="s3"> good</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:20.830" end="00:18:24.010" style="s2">question another way<span style="s3"> to</span> think about it</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:25.900" style="s2">is that when a landlord gives an</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.010" end="00:18:28.060" style="s2">eviction notice they&#39;re essentially</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.900" end="00:18:29.680" style="s2">initiating a negotiation like a business</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.060" end="00:18:32.350" style="s2">negotiation they&#39;re saying<span style="s3"> you</span> have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.680" end="00:18:34.450" style="s2"><span style="s3">leave</span> in 30 days unlike any other</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.350" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">negotiation if you have leverage that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.450" end="00:18:38.110" style="s2">improves your negotiating leverage so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:39.910" style="s2">that improve the chance for a tenant to</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.110" end="00:18:42.010" style="s2">be able to say<span style="s3"> actually</span><span style="s4"> i</span> would<span style="s4"> like</span> a</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.910" end="00:18:44.050" style="s2">new lease at the same level of rent</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.010" end="00:18:46.360" style="s2">which we&#39;ve been able to<span style="s3"> achieve</span> using</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.050" end="00:18:50.440" style="s2">these tactics but more often it says</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.360" end="00:18:52.660" style="s2">well like i can&#39;t i can&#39;t<span style="s3"> move</span> right<span style="s4"> now</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:50.440" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">so<span style="s3"> i&#39;m</span> going<span style="s3"> to use the information that</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:52.660" end="00:18:56.530" style="s2"><span style="s4">we&#39;ve collected to create strategic</span></p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:59.860" style="s2">leverage for myself my family and my</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.530" end="00:19:01.270" style="s2">neighbors to improve upon those terms so</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.860" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">maybe<span style="s3"> instead</span> of a month<span style="s3"> i</span> want six</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.270" end="00:19:07.390" style="s2">months maybe<span style="s4"> instead</span> of 30 days I want</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:09.460" style="s2">moving expenses paid right it&#39;s both an</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.390" end="00:19:11.290" style="s2">opportunity to like to fight evictions</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.460" end="00:19:13.240" style="s2">on the individual level but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.290" end="00:19:16.900" style="s2">of people&#39;s quality of living I know if</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.240" end="00:19:18.780" style="s2">that helps whoever happens to grant</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.900" end="00:19:21.040" style="s2">strikes in a third possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.780" end="00:19:25.090" style="s2">banding together tenants and mobile</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.040" end="00:19:26.530" style="s2">buildings that landlord my own that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.090" end="00:19:29.940" style="s2">actually<span style="s4"> an</span> intention of this and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.530" end="00:19:33.250" style="s2">going<span style="s3"> to let know what talk on that um</span></p>
<p begin="00:19:29.940" end="00:19:36.310" style="s2">so if you<span style="s4"> have</span> answers Oh al that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.250" end="00:19:37.210" style="s2">really good question so I think so there</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.310" end="00:19:39.490" style="s2">is something called<span style="s3"> a</span> rent reduction</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.210" end="00:19:42.490" style="s2">letter in Chicago where you can reduce a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.490" end="00:19:45.910" style="s2">portion of your rent if the landlord is</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.490" end="00:19:47.950" style="s2">not making<span style="s3"> repairs</span> but since the primary</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.910" end="00:19:50.520" style="s2">crisis right now in Chicago isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.950" end="00:19:52.540" style="s2">conditions like it was in the 80s or 90s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.520" end="00:19:54.370" style="s2">landlords actually wants you to not pay</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.540" end="00:19:55.630" style="s2">your rent so I get the hell if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.370" end="00:19:57.580" style="s2">pay rent that&#39;s<span style="s3"> not</span> get the hell out and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.630" end="00:19:59.800" style="s2">since a lot of the companies like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.580" end="00:20:03.160" style="s2"><span style="s3">talking</span> about jb realty<span style="s3"> fishman</span> silver</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.800" end="00:20:05.080" style="s2">properties some of these<span style="s4"> big</span> flats is</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.160" end="00:20:07.090" style="s2">another big one you could strike one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.080" end="00:20:08.350" style="s2"><span style="s3">their</span> properties but if 30 tenants</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.090" end="00:20:10.450" style="s2">aren&#39;t paying rent but they really<span style="s3"> want</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:08.350" end="00:20:12.430" style="s2">to<span style="s3"> kick</span> out anyway and<span style="s3"> I</span> have 300 units</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.450" end="00:20:14.620" style="s2"><span style="s4">they&#39;re</span> like great please go on strike</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.430" end="00:20:17.550" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a bad idea in<span style="s3"> their</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:14.620" end="00:20:19.900" style="s2">strategic ways that you can do that<span style="s3"> um</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:17.550" end="00:20:22.150" style="s2">it&#39;s<span style="s4"> just</span> not something that&#39;s like<span style="s3"> an</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:19.900" end="00:20:23.640" style="s2">initial doesn&#39;t make sense well we</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.150" end="00:20:28.840" style="s2">should talk about<span style="s4"> it</span> after if you<span style="s4"> want</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:23.640" end="00:20:30.130" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting very ring yeah I<span style="s3"> don&#39;t</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:28.840" end="00:20:35.410" style="s2"><span style="s3">think</span> I don&#39;t have much add to that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.130" end="00:20:37.420" style="s2"><span style="s3">think</span><span style="s4"> that</span> I question I&#39;m so sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.410" end="00:20:39.910" style="s2">building off that it seems like<span style="s3"> you</span> have</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.420" end="00:20:42.040" style="s2">all<span style="s3"> this</span> data about the landlord&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.910" end="00:20:44.260" style="s2">mentioned actually a few<span style="s3"> by</span> name private</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.040" end="00:20:45.880" style="s2">you maybe you could<span style="s4"> think</span> our problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.260" end="00:20:47.260" style="s2">landlords seems like there might be an</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.880" end="00:20:49.720" style="s2">opportunity to take<span style="s3"> the</span> state and sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.260" end="00:20:51.220" style="s2">of identify those problem landlords<span style="s3"> I</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:49.720" end="00:20:53.710" style="s2">think the city actually releases a data</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.220" end="00:20:55.090" style="s2">set of proper like bad landlords around</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.710" end="00:20:58.120" style="s2">like the naughty list or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.090" end="00:20:59.680" style="s2">city collects so how do you have you</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.120" end="00:21:01.450" style="s2">looked at that<span style="s3"> data set or if you</span></p>
<p begin="00:20:59.680" end="00:21:02.980" style="s2">thought about collaborating that data</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.450" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">set with your own data and maybe sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.980" end="00:21:07.510" style="s2">using sort of the aggregate<span style="s3"> information</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">that you have<span style="s4"> to</span><span style="s3"> sort of maybe target</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:07.510" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">some more</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.619" end="00:21:16.350" style="s2">one thing I did want to point out that<span style="s3"> i</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:14.789" end="00:21:18.539" style="s2">don&#39;t<span style="s3"> think</span> was highlighted that<span style="s3"> i</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:16.350" end="00:21:20.489" style="s2"><span style="s3">learned</span> about<span style="s3"> during</span> the hackathon was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.539" end="00:21:22.139" style="s2">lot of tenants don&#39;t know who their</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.489" end="00:21:23.909" style="s2">landlord is in the first place a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.139" end="00:21:26.700" style="s2"><span style="s3">tenants</span> don&#39;t have Lisa&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.909" end="00:21:28.919" style="s2">landlords hide behind multiple LLC&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.700" end="00:21:30.659" style="s2">they have<span style="s4"> no</span><span style="s3"> idea</span> so even if they they</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.919" end="00:21:32.429" style="s2">might think someone is their landlord</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.659" end="00:21:33.899" style="s2">and they could<span style="s3"> look</span> it up on that on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.429" end="00:21:35.879" style="s2">list like that and they actually<span style="s4"> don&#39;t</span></p>
<p begin="00:21:33.899" end="00:21:37.950" style="s2">know so one<span style="s4"> of</span> the goals<span style="s4"> of</span> that is so</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.779" end="00:21:55.739" style="s2">pretty impressive form of leverage some</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.369" end="00:21:57.419" style="s2">landlords will give a 30 day notice then</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.739" end="00:21:59.639" style="s2">come back to<span style="s3"> the</span> negotiating table after</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.419" end="00:22:01.409" style="s2">doing that once a tenant has reached out</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.950" end="00:25:47.760" style="s2">affected us this past July when we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.960" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">our home base cool dude I&#39;m<span style="s4"> Pilsen</span> and</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.220" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">temporarily but the reason why we lost</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.050" end="00:26:04.800" style="s2">our home is because our landlord doubled</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">our rent and it was impossible for us as</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.800" end="00:26:09.540" style="s2">a non-profit full of nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:13.309" style="s2">organizations<span style="s3"> to</span> be<span style="s4"> able</span> to pay rent so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.540" end="00:26:16.020" style="s2">definitely raising rents is one way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.309" end="00:26:24.150" style="s2">landlords of course tried to change<span style="s3"> the</span></p>

<p begin="00:26:32.250" end="00:26:40.620" style="s2">for<span style="s4"> to</span> focusing on not available helping</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.440" end="00:26:43.650" style="s2">through that process I&#39;ll just quickly</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.620" end="00:26:47.130" style="s2">answer i think that the pacific scope of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.650" end="00:26:48.900" style="s2">the people here are I think tackling</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.130" end="00:26:51.150" style="s2">gentrification on in one front and i</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.900" end="00:26:54.540" style="s2">think that there&#39;s opportunity for us as</p>

<p begin="00:26:58.679" end="00:27:04.470" style="s2"><span style="s3">that&#39;s that was a very important issue</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:07.890" style="s2">for us to continue grappling with and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.470" end="00:27:09.540" style="s2">defending our communities so<span style="s4"> i</span> think</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.890" end="00:27:11.070" style="s2"><span style="s3">that</span> we&#39;re<span style="s3"> definitely</span> going to have</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.799" end="00:27:18.210" style="s2">to address this issue so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.870" end="00:27:22.230" style="s2"><span style="s3">having</span> the opportunity to work<span style="s3"> with</span></p>

<p begin="00:28:51.929" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">for us so we were very intentional about</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.900" end="00:28:59.280" style="s2">that so I<span style="s3"> think</span> that<span style="s3"> part</span> of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:00.870" style="s2">we you know part of how we would</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.280" end="00:29:03.690" style="s2">distribute this kind of information is</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.870" end="00:29:06.510" style="s2">you know first hand reaching out<span style="s3"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:03.690" end="00:29:08.549" style="s2">having people involved that are reaching</p>

<p begin="00:29:15.240" end="00:29:21.030" style="s2"><span style="s3">like whatever the first point of</span></p>
<p begin="00:29:17.570" end="00:29:23.220" style="s2">exposure would be the people and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.030" end="00:29:26.040" style="s2"><span style="s3">obviously</span> we have a<span style="s3"> really</span> huge medium</p>
