<p begin="00:47:00.029" end="00:47:06.059" style="s2">so there&#39;s you know politicians because</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:08.339" style="s2">they don&#39;t often know that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.059" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">rubric I get a lot of accusations</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.339" end="00:47:14.489" style="s2">especially when<span style="s4"> I</span> first<span style="s3"> started</span> um</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:16.950" style="s2">particularly in Springfield there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.489" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">lot<span style="s3"> of</span> accusations like oh well the</p>

<p begin="00:58:48.509" end="00:58:55.950" style="s2">lawns and keep<span style="s4"> people</span> from thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.930" end="00:58:57.060" style="s2"><span style="s3">it</span> was dead and and so that was the</p>

<p begin="00:58:57.060" end="00:59:05.130" style="s2"><span style="s3">either one because there was no movement</span></p>
<p begin="00:58:59.220" end="00:59:09.630" style="s2">in the<span style="s3"> administration</span> wanted to<span style="s4"> wait</span> for</p>

<p begin="00:59:09.630" end="00:59:17.090" style="s2"><span style="s3">think</span> they<span style="s3"> wanted to see if it if it</span></p>
<p begin="00:59:12.150" end="00:59:20.220" style="s2">would just go away um there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.090" end="00:59:24.810" style="s2">discussion during the negotiations about</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.220" end="00:59:27.240" style="s2">what was feasible<span style="s4"> to</span> expect and<span style="s4"> you</span> know</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.810" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">we had a kind of<span style="s4"> low</span> threshold we first</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.240" end="00:59:34.410" style="s2">started and there was questions about</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:37.320" style="s2">whether that was a good<span style="s3"> thing</span> whether we</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.410" end="00:59:39.390" style="s2">should and construction projects would</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.320" end="00:59:41.100" style="s2">fall under that weathered if you kids</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.390" end="00:59:43.530" style="s2">are professionals with them or whether</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.100" end="00:59:46.170" style="s2">they should be exempted<span style="s4"> so</span> there was a</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.530" end="00:59:48.990" style="s2">lot of back and forth about things once</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.170" end="00:59:51.330" style="s2">we got to the table but it was keeping</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.990" end="00:59:55.550" style="s2">it relevant and cheap many people</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.330" end="00:59:58.260" style="s2">thinking<span style="s3"> Oh</span> less that&#39;s not happening um</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.550" end="01:00:00.120" style="s2">that was the big problem and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.260" end="01:00:02.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot<span style="s3"> of something it&#39;s</span></p>
<p begin="01:00:00.120" end="01:00:08.280" style="s2">introduced in<span style="s4"> City Council some of it</span></p>
<p begin="01:00:02.430" end="01:00:10.860" style="s2">good some of it random um but a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.280" end="01:00:12.900" style="s2">stuff just and something rules or even</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.860" end="01:00:15.330" style="s2">gets into a committee and just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.900" end="01:00:18.170" style="s2"><span style="s3">ever</span> get hurt there&#39;s a<span style="s4"> lot</span> of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.330" end="01:00:22.190" style="s2"><span style="s3">that</span> gets is just sitting a committee um</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.170" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">so so that&#39;s the<span style="s4"> big</span> problem some of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.190" end="01:00:30.330" style="s2"><span style="s3">personally</span> some people just introduced</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:34.830" style="s2">legislation may be a good<span style="s4"> idea</span> but may</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.330" end="01:00:37.650" style="s2">not really<span style="s4"> work</span> it and um so you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.830" end="01:00:40.830" style="s2">five people that took closest to sign a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.650" end="01:00:43.290" style="s2">bill and it<span style="s4"> gets</span> assigned to a committee</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.830" end="01:00:46.230" style="s2">but it&#39;s not getting her thing people</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.290" end="01:00:49.170" style="s2">aren&#39;t trying to<span style="s4"> get</span> more co-sponsors or</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.230" end="01:00:51.480" style="s2">doing fuss or a lot of the legwork that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.170" end="01:00:54.720" style="s2">it takes to actually get the<span style="s4"> thing</span></p>
<p begin="01:00:51.480" end="01:00:57.150" style="s2">passed so that&#39;s why a lot of things a</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.720" end="01:00:59.400" style="s2">battle to it&#39;s not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.150" end="01:01:00.810" style="s2">malicious thing but just since it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.400" end="01:01:06.270" style="s2">automatically go through the process</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.810" end="01:01:09.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not<span style="s4"> it&#39;s</span> not<span style="s4"> being graded mention</span></p>
<p begin="01:01:06.270" end="01:01:10.500" style="s2">them only the<span style="s4"> things</span> you to do is pass</p>
