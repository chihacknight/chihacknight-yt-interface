<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">is this clown<span style="s4"> all right so it started</span></p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:39.570" style="s2">out with<span style="s4"> a</span> story in The New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:42.690" style="s2">about how the rating system used by</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.570" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">nursing homes was not reflective of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.690" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">reality there were homes that were rated</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">really well that had<span style="s4"> some</span> really</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">horrific problems and so it began with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.899" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">new york<span style="s3"> times</span> story and then a<span style="s4"> Ted Ted</span></p>
<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:56.579" style="s2">is no longer here but Ted was the guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:59.250" style="s2">that came up<span style="s4"> with the</span><span style="s3"> idea</span> and<span style="s4"> I</span> tagged</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.579" end="00:01:03.690" style="s2">along a few<span style="s4"> weeks</span> later and we got this</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.250" end="00:01:06.540" style="s2">thing going so then our objective was to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.690" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">create a better rating system so we</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.540" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2"><span style="s3">built</span> a really<span style="s4"> complicated</span> web site with</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">the back end and a lot of took a whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">lot of<span style="s4"> work to do</span><span style="s3"> anything but we it</span></p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:21.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t really<span style="s3"> take</span> off so after<span style="s3"> a</span> couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">months one person<span style="s4"> another</span> person it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.270" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">moved on<span style="s4"> to</span> other things and the a team</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">disbanded so b-list guy<span style="s3"> I</span> took<span style="s4"> a</span> long</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">weekend and actually used the system</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">developed by Derek to just throw up a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">quick map that displayed the ratings of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:43.130" style="s2">nursing homes all really already</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">available on the Medicare website and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.130" end="00:01:47.790" style="s2">then lo and behold have people were</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">interested again so then we got a second</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">wind and then we built a site with no</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">back end because the all the work we</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2"><span style="s3">were</span> putting into the database I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">really distracting and it was hard to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2"><span style="s3">find</span> a database person who would</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:02.990" style="s2">consistently volunteer so we just built</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">the<span style="s4"> site</span> that pulls data directly from</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.990" end="00:02:09.590" style="s2">dayton<span style="s4"> medicare</span> gov and you can too and</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.349" end="00:02:21.239" style="s2">have dated medicare.gov Oh what have I</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">done how&#39;s the mouse work here we go so</p>

<p begin="00:02:35.129" end="00:02:42.299" style="s2">gives you this which is a list of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.730" end="00:02:44.489" style="s2">nursing homes and<span style="s3"> five-star</span> ratings on</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.299" end="00:02:46.620" style="s2">several different categories and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.489" end="00:02:51.079" style="s2">a lot of<span style="s4"> good</span> info here but you can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:02:53.189" end="00:02:57.540" style="s2">understanding of what&#39;s going on so if</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.930" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">you go to<span style="s4"> the</span> map view they created it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.540" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">gives you just a little handful of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:05.129" style="s2">nursing homes and you have to click into</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.639" end="00:03:49.979" style="s2">focused on the ratings but what we saw</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.919" end="00:03:52.500" style="s2">when you<span style="s4"> put</span> it<span style="s4"> on</span> a map is that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:04:20.199" end="00:04:24.910" style="s2">their staffing is low in their nursing</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.940" end="00:04:28.120" style="s2">level is low and then recently<span style="s4"> we</span> have</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.169" end="00:04:37.389" style="s2">issues<span style="s4"> later</span> but are they administering</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">antipsychotic medications to residents</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.389" end="00:04:41.139" style="s2">who don&#39;t need antipsychotic medications</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:44.889" style="s2">residents who are<span style="s3"> just</span> having a<span style="s3"> hard</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:41.139" end="00:04:46.930" style="s2">time or they&#39;re excited we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.889" end="00:04:48.220" style="s2">explanations for all the ratings<span style="s4"> and</span></p>
<p begin="00:04:46.930" end="00:04:51.310" style="s2"><span style="s4">this</span> stuff I pulled directly from</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.220" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">Medicare so again team no<span style="s3"> back-end</span> right</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.310" end="00:04:54.699" style="s2">we got the<span style="s4"> information</span> about<span style="s4"> the</span> owners</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:56.440" style="s2"><span style="s3">and</span> we&#39;ve got all their latest</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.699" end="00:05:00.340" style="s2">deficiencies which is pulled directly</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.440" end="00:05:01.780" style="s2">from Medicare can I just jump in here to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.340" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">talk about why they use antipsychotics</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.780" end="00:05:07.720" style="s2">it&#39;s because physical restraints are now</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:08.740" style="s2">mostly illegal so places that use see</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.720" end="00:05:10.509" style="s2">this is another metric that gets a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.740" end="00:05:12.039" style="s2">little tricky but often a heavy use of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.509" end="00:05:13.539" style="s2">antipsychotic medication can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.039" end="00:05:16.419" style="s2">indicative of what they call a chemical</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.539" end="00:05:18.729" style="s2">restraint but some facilities have large</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.419" end="00:05:20.289" style="s2">like Jerry psychiatric patients when</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.729" end="00:05:23.400" style="s2">they might be using<span style="s4"> this</span> for the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.289" end="00:05:27.190" style="s2">reasons so anyway yeah it&#39;s<span style="s4"> a good point</span></p>
<p begin="00:05:23.400" end="00:05:28.570" style="s2">so two point oh we may talk about later</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.190" end="00:05:32.020" style="s2">but I&#39;m<span style="s4"> going to keep</span><span style="s3"> coming</span> to hack</p>

<p begin="00:05:32.020" end="00:05:34.509" style="s2">talk<span style="s4"> a</span> little bit about the situation</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.949" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">before I hand it over to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.509" end="00:05:38.860" style="s2">actually knows something about this</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.389" end="00:05:50.680" style="s2">and so some of the<span style="s3"> things</span> they talked</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.190" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">about where the what they believe may be</p>

<p begin="00:09:35.510" end="00:09:40.550" style="s2">is the 65 plus population and then I put</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:43.399" style="s2">Florida right at the twenty<span style="s3"> percent</span> mark</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.550" end="00:09:45.740" style="s2">because Florida&#39;s 65 plus population</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.399" end="00:09:48.260" style="s2">right now is it about twenty<span style="s3"> percent</span> so</p>

<p begin="00:11:05.240" end="00:11:11.060" style="s2">trying to do is<span style="s4"> to</span> take the specialized</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.670" end="00:15:43.420" style="s2">a reply leting like let&#39;s say larger</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.449" end="00:15:46.220" style="s2">intervention is frankly not scalable</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.420" end="00:15:48.379" style="s2">with one particular nursing home and<span style="s4"> the</span></p>

<p begin="00:15:50.689" end="00:15:54.589" style="s2">and you know the<span style="s4"> other thing that</span> I</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.189" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">thought about was there<span style="s4"> there</span> at three</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.589" end="00:16:00.709" style="s2">stars when it comes to staffing<span style="s4"> to</span> and</p>

<p begin="00:16:09.619" end="00:16:12.829" style="s2">redesign or whole curriculum because</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.850" end="00:16:14.600" style="s2">there&#39;s people have no opportunity to</p>

<p begin="00:16:20.299" end="00:16:27.290" style="s2">stars I&#39;m wondering<span style="s3"> what</span> staffing at one</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.290" end="00:16:34.009" style="s2">little<span style="s3"> bit</span> scary but anyway the</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.970" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">in a or maybe horrified to think about</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.340" end="00:21:59.150" style="s2">what some of the staffing ratios may be</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:03.410" style="s2">like and some of these other facilities</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.150" end="00:22:11.390" style="s2">up here it&#39;s like 30 30 to 1 30 to 40 to</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.820" end="00:23:21.270" style="s2">tries<span style="s3"> to</span> do is switch the facility it</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.480" end="00:24:39.530" style="s2">I mean the they do have interests and</p>

<p begin="00:24:58.430" end="00:25:01.370" style="s2">had some feedback like<span style="s4"> a</span> little bit</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.240" end="00:25:15.980" style="s2">now is that it for the longest time and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.090" end="00:25:17.150" style="s2"><span style="s3">I</span> believe still<span style="s4"> is</span> currently that when</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.140" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">something like that<span style="s4"> so</span> if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.370" end="00:25:33.650" style="s2">wanted<span style="s3"> to</span> sue the nursing home they</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.160" end="00:25:55.370" style="s2">seen at least electronic monitoring is</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.210" end="00:26:26.119" style="s2">certainly the city so there are you<span style="s4"> know</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:23.539" end="00:26:28.970" style="s2">nurse to nurse to resident nurse to</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.119" end="00:26:30.619" style="s2">patient ratios unfortunately I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.970" end="00:26:32.299" style="s2">honestly not sure quite what they are I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.619" end="00:26:40.539" style="s2">know there&#39;s legal limits but they must</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.299" end="00:26:43.519" style="s2">be pretty darn low I mean it so yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.539" end="00:26:45.349" style="s2">those ratios actually play into why</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.519" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">something like the greenhouse project</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.349" end="00:26:49.940" style="s2">and the<span style="s4"> pioneer</span> network is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:51.169" style="s2">the founder of that has had a lot<span style="s4"> of</span></p>
<p begin="00:26:49.940" end="00:26:52.129" style="s2">trouble in<span style="s4"> this</span> area<span style="s4"> and</span> would the</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.169" end="00:26:55.129" style="s2">reason why I said<span style="s3"> it</span> had<span style="s3"> to</span> do with</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.129" end="00:26:56.929" style="s2">zoning was because again the greenhouse</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.129" end="00:26:59.359" style="s2">model is highly residential and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.929" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">actually they it&#39;s<span style="s4"> designed</span> from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.359" end="00:27:04.309" style="s2">ground up to be to have fidelity with</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:07.580" style="s2">this<span style="s3"> particular</span> model and<span style="s3"> that</span> means</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.309" end="00:27:09.470" style="s2">little<span style="s4"> houses</span> but the problem<span style="s3"> is</span> then</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.580" end="00:27:12.499" style="s2">you have to have way more nursing staff</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.470" end="00:27:14.690" style="s2">because of those staff to resident</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.499" end="00:27:15.859" style="s2">ratios so if you in<span style="s4"> this</span> one building</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.690" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">you might have to have a minimum<span style="s4"> of</span> how</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.859" end="00:27:19.549" style="s2">many<span style="s3"> of</span><span style="s4"> our</span> nurses well that&#39;s fine if</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:22.279" style="s2">you&#39;ve got<span style="s3"> 200</span> residents you can keep it</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.549" end="00:27:23.599" style="s2">low but<span style="s4"> if</span> you&#39;ve got<span style="s3"> 12</span> residents that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.279" end="00:27:29.029" style="s2"><span style="s4">becomes more problematic and that&#39;s why</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:23.599" end="00:27:31.059" style="s2">it ties back to zoning does<span style="s4"> that</span> make</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.029" end="00:27:31.059" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.290" end="00:27:39.230" style="s2">city and suburbs yeah it is their</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.740" end="00:27:40.980" style="s2">oversight built into these Medicaid</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.389" end="00:28:59.549" style="s2">that with our particular nursing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.370" end="00:29:02.620" style="s2">that we were focusing on when you know</p>
