<p begin="00:16:03.899" end="00:16:08.310" style="s2">practice in<span style="s4"> the</span> industry and they do</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.660" end="00:16:09.569" style="s2">some delivery as well so the Department</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.360" end="00:16:59.310" style="s2">of regulations and the<span style="s3"> problem</span> is is</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.950" end="00:24:38.180" style="s2">quo honestly so we have to figure<span style="s3"> that</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:33.450" end="00:24:38.180" style="s2">out you</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.940" end="00:24:54.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I so<span style="s4"> there&#39;s</span><span style="s3"> a</span> spanish</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.980" end="00:24:58.700" style="s2">part the same infrastructure underneath</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:01.190" style="s2">there was a layer on<span style="s4"> top</span> they<span style="s3"> actually</span></p>
<p begin="00:24:58.700" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">deployed it in two separate they</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">the translation pieces at the<span style="s3"> very</span> front</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.250" end="00:25:18.170" style="s2">end so yeah there I remember there being</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:19.430" style="s2">some challenges with that<span style="s4"> early on but I</span></p>
<p begin="00:25:18.170" end="00:25:20.600" style="s2">think they got all ironed out I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.230" end="00:25:46.280" style="s2">is to<span style="s3"> your</span> question yeah yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.540" end="00:25:48.410" style="s2">the thinking there was like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.280" end="00:25:50.210" style="s2">going to be more traffic to the English</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.410" end="00:25:51.620" style="s2">language site than the Spanish language</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.210" end="00:25:54.500" style="s2">site so let&#39;s allocate more resources</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.510" end="00:27:01.420" style="s2">again it was it was a<span style="s3"> different</span> mindset</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.290" end="00:27:02.980" style="s2">it was a<span style="s3"> different</span> mode we were trying</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.980" end="00:27:06.820" style="s2">development in the agile process it<span style="s3"> was</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:04.690" end="00:27:08.770" style="s2">more about we are in crisis we need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.820" end="00:27:11.740" style="s2">triage the critical problems that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.770" end="00:27:14.380" style="s2">have<span style="s3"> and</span> fix them so operations mainly</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.740" end="00:27:16.660" style="s2">is when they saw the way<span style="s4"> that</span> we worked</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.380" end="00:27:21.130" style="s2">and how quickly we could work breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.660" end="00:27:22.270" style="s2">problems triage them and just<span style="s3"> because</span> of</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.130" end="00:27:24.280" style="s2">our experience having worked on high</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.280" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">problems yeah that rallied a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.250" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2"><span style="s3">people</span> to the cause and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:35.950" style="s2">there was a lot of like after the fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:38.740" style="s2">looking back and trying<span style="s3"> to</span> codify what</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.950" end="00:27:40.030" style="s2">we did in<span style="s4"> fact</span> the<span style="s3"> USD s created</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:38.740" end="00:27:43.510" style="s2">something called the playbook which is</p>

<p begin="00:27:43.510" end="00:27:49.740" style="s2">did<span style="s3"> on</span> the<span style="s4"> rescue</span> like the exact tactics</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.790" end="00:27:51.490" style="s2">that we took as far as you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.740" end="00:27:54.790" style="s2">prospectively looking forward in</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.490" end="00:27:57.280" style="s2">software development yeah we&#39;re<span style="s3"> getting</span></p>
<p begin="00:27:54.790" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2"><span style="s4">there</span> like<span style="s4"> there</span> were groups of people</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:04.270" style="s2"><span style="s3">did</span> a scrum training and that was great</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.000" end="00:28:06.160" style="s2">like they<span style="s3"> probably</span> had the zeal of the</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.160" end="00:28:10.510" style="s2"><span style="s3">necessarily the most helpful thing but</span></p>
<p begin="00:28:08.170" end="00:28:12.400" style="s2">it&#39;s better than<span style="s4"> the</span> status quo so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.510" end="00:28:13.660" style="s2">know I i think the virus is kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.400" end="00:28:15.970" style="s2">the system is<span style="s3"> starting</span> to work its way</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.660" end="00:28:18.610" style="s2">through like government agencies</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.970" end="00:28:20.470" style="s2">recognize that it&#39;s the status quo is</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.610" end="00:28:21.580" style="s2">broken and they they don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.470" end="00:28:23.560" style="s2"><span style="s3">get</span> from here<span style="s4"> to</span> there and we&#39;re trying</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.560" end="00:28:26.980" style="s2">trying to show them it rubs up against</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:28.410" style="s2">the way their whole bureaucracy is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.980" end="00:28:33.900" style="s2">structured<span style="s3"> so that&#39;s</span><span style="s4"> just</span> the real</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.410" end="00:28:33.900" style="s2">problem you right here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.489" end="00:28:42.139" style="s2">based on feedback into</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.530" end="00:28:57.610" style="s2">yet i would say everything we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.200" end="00:28:59.550" style="s2">talking about has been you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.610" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">federal focus that&#39;s where a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.390" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">many ways is probably the scale is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.650" end="00:29:15.220" style="s2">comparable with federal government</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">because if you think 50 states you know</p>
