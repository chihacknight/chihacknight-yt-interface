<p begin="00:31:22.509" end="00:31:30.679" style="s2">I&#39;m with you and I<span style="s3"> think</span> in general we</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.860" end="00:31:33.710" style="s2">need to find<span style="s3"> ways</span> to to make sure that</p>

<p begin="00:31:40.879" end="00:31:43.730" style="s2">a hard argument to make right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.019" end="00:31:46.519" style="s2"><span style="s3">because</span> we&#39;re in such dire straits in</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.409" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s hard<span style="s3"> to</span> talk about almost anything</p>
